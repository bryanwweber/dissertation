\begin{document}
The detailed conclusions relevant to each of the experimental works
considered in this study are presented in their respective chapters.
The following gives a general summary of the previous works and provides
recommendations for future work, including descriptions of ongoing
investigations using a new sampling system.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:overall-conclusions}
The studies reported in this work are the first experiments exploring
the low-to-intermediate temperature autoignition of the butanol isomers.
These data provide a unique look into the behavior of these fuels under
engine-relevant conditions. For the stoichiometric condition at two
pressures, \nBuOH{} was the most reactive of the isomers. However, the
order of the reactivity of the other isomers depended on the prevailing
pressure conditions during the induction period. \tBuOH{} became the
second most reactive isomer at the higher pressure condition and showed
unique behavior during the induction period. Analysis of a detailed
kinetic model for combustion of the butanol isomers elucidated the
controlling chemistry during the autoignition of the four isomers,
and indicated that the different behavior of \tBuOH{} is due to a unique
set of controlling reactions for \tBuOH{}.

\section{Fast Sampling System}
\label{sec:fast-sampling}

The fast sampling system (FSS) used in this work is a commercial system supplied by
SME-Tec Gmbh. from Germany. The FSS is composed of two parts, the gas sampling valve
(GSV) and the Controller. A schematic of the GSV is shown in \cref{fig:valve-schematic}.
Gases are admitted from the reaction chamber into the heated carrying tubes
through the poppet-style valve on the left of the GSV. The sampled gases are then
conducted through the GSV outlet into the \SI{15}{\milli\liter} sampling bottle.

A schematic of the GSV assembly is shown in \cref{fig:gsv-assem-schematic}.
The GSV is mounted to the RCM by a custom-made end plug. The reaction chamber
is sealed by an O-ring on the small- and large-diameter portions of the GSV.
The depth that the GSV is inserted into the reaction chamber is adjustable
by adding or removing shims in the end plug assembly. The insertion depth
is chosen so that the tip of the GSV is outside the boundary layer on the
end wall.

The portion of the GSV protruding into the reaction chamber has minimal
effect on the homogeneity of the reaction chamber. Moreover, the removal of
samples has minimal effect on the measured ignition delay.
This has been verified experimentally by measuring the ignition delay with
and without the GSV present, and with and without sampling occurring.
In both cases, the difference in ignition delay was statistically insignificant
for $\alpha=0.05$.

The close-open-close (COC) cycle of the GSV is controlled by a mass-spring
system. The poppet face is connected to a rod running the length of the
GSV and connected to the mass at the rear of the valve. To open the poppet,
the mass is accelerated forward by passing current through the coil around
the mass. The rod is also
connected to a spring that is used to restore the poppet to its original
position after being extended.

The GSV has an adjustable COC time, by adjusting the
distance the plate is allowed to move. Furthermore, the GSV has the ability
to measure the displacement of the mass, allowing the direct measurement of
the COC time and the absolute time of opening.

The GSV controller is triggered by a \SI{5}{\volt} signal from the cDAQ.
The timing of the trigger signal is controlled by the LabView VI. The pressure
signal from the reaction chamber is read from the cDAQ in \SI{1}{\milli\second}
chunks in a loop. On each loop iteration, the maximum pressure is checked
against a desired trigger pressure; when the reaction chamber pressure exceeds
the trigger pressure, the cDAQ sends the trigger to the GSV controller. The
GSV controller has an adjustable delay (\SIrange{4.5}{70}{\milli\second}) that
is used to control the timing of the opening of the GSV during the induction period.
The absolute opening time of the GSV is thus dependent on three parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The cable delays from the PC to the cDAQ; from the cDAQ to the GSV
      controller; and from the GSV controller to the GSV itself
\item The processing time of the LabView VI
\item The delay set in the GSV controller.
\end{enumerate}

However, since the absolute opening time of the GSV can be measured by
the signal sent from the GSV to the controller (and thence to the cDAQ),
the uncertainty in the opening time is actually quite small, and is related
to the cable delay in sending the COC signal from the GSV to the cDAQ and
the precision of the A/D conversion in the cDAQ. The uncertainty of the
absolute opening time is thus estimated as $\pm \SI{1}{\micro\second}$. \todo{Verify this number}

Furthermore, the correspondence of the COC signal from the valve with
the physical valve movements has been experimentally verified by
high speed video. Frames from these videos are shown in \cref{fig:valve-video}.
The frames show that the opening and closing times of the valve face
correspond closely with repeatable points in the peak of the voltage.

\subsection{Experimental Procedure}

Prior to an experiment, the GSV and sampling bottle are vacuumed to less
than \SI{1}{\torr}. The reaction chamber is vacuumed and filled in the same
procedure as described previously, and the compression is triggered. For a given
trigger pressure and controller delay, the GSV opens at some time after the EOC
and removes a gas sample from the reaction chamber. The sample is diluted by
high purity helium. Then the sample bottle is disconnected from the GSV and transported
to the Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer, where the sample undergoes analysis.
