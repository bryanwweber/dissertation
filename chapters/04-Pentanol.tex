\section{Structure of \textit{i}-Pentanol}
\label{sec:ipeoh-struct}

\textit{i}-Pentanol (3-methyl-1-butanol) is a five-carbon alcohol whose skeletal
structure is shown in \cref{fig:ipeoh-skeletal}. \textit{i}-Pentanol can
be produced biologically, and offers several similar advantages as the butanol
isomers as compared to ethanol. \Cref{tab:ipeoh-heats} compares the HHV
of ethanol, \iPeOH{}, and gasoline.

\section{Procedures}
\label{sec:ipeoh-procedure}

Experiments for \iPeOH{} have been performed at the conditions listed
in \cref{tab:ipeoh-expts}. Homogeneous fuel and air pre-mixtures are prepared in an approximately
\SI{17}{\liter} mixing tank. The mixing tank and all tubes and manifolds
connecting the tank with the RCM are heated, allowing the study of
relatively low vapor pressure fuels. The initial temperature is set above
the saturation temperature of \iPeOH{} for each mixture studied. The mixing
tank is equipped with a magnetic stirrer to ensure complete homogeneity
of the mixture.

Prior to mixture preparation, the mixing tank is vacuumed to less than
\SI{1}{\torr}, whereupon liquid fuel (\iPeOH{}, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.6\%
purity) is injected by a syringe through a septum. The syringe is massed
before and after the injection, with the difference being the amount of
fuel in the mixing tank. Based on this mass, required proportions of
the gaseous oxidizer (O2, 99.994\% purity, N2, 99.999\% purity) are
calculated. The gases are added to the mixing tank sequentially at
room temperature and the total pressure is monitored to ensure the
proper mixture concentrations are attained. Finally, the heaters and
stirring vane are switched on and the system is allowed approximately
\SI{1.5}{\hour} to reach steady state.

\section{Model Improvements}
Through collaboration with researchers at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, many improvements to the chemical kinetic model for \iPeOH{} were
made relative to the work of \textcite{Tsujimura2012}. Some of the major
improvements are highlighted below; see the article for more detail
\cite{Sarathy2013}.
