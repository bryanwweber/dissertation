\section{Structure of \textit{i}-Pentanol}
\label{sec:ipeoh-struct}

\textit{i}-Pentanol (3-methyl-1-butanol) is a five-carbon alcohol whose skeletal
structure is shown in \cref{fig:ipeoh-skeletal}. \textit{i}-Pentanol can
be produced biologically, and offers several similar advantages as the butanol
isomers as compared to ethanol. \Cref{tab:ipeoh-heats} compares the HHV
of ethanol, \iPeOH{}, and gasoline.

\section{Procedures}
\label{sec:ipeoh-procedure}

Experiments for \iPeOH{} in the RCM have been performed at the conditions listed
in \cref{tab:ipeoh-expts}. Homogeneous fuel and air pre-mixtures are prepared in an approximately
\SI{17}{\liter} mixing tank. The mixing tank and all tubes and manifolds
connecting the tank with the RCM are heated, allowing the study of
relatively low vapor pressure fuels. The initial temperature is set above
the saturation temperature of \iPeOH{} for each mixture studied. The mixing
tank is equipped with a magnetic stirrer to ensure complete homogeneity
of the mixture.

    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Prior to mixture preparation, the mixing tank is vacuumed to less than
\SI{1}{\torr}, whereupon liquid fuel (\iPeOH{}, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.6\%
purity) is injected by a syringe through a septum. The syringe is massed
before and after the injection, with the difference being the amount of
fuel in the mixing tank. Based on this mass, required proportions of
the gaseous oxidizer (O2, 99.994\% purity, N2, 99.999\% purity) are
calculated. The gases are added to the mixing tank sequentially at
room temperature and the total pressure is monitored to ensure the
proper mixture concentrations are attained. Finally, the heaters and
stirring vane are switched on and the system is allowed approximately
\SI{1.5}{\hour} to reach steady state.

\section{Model Improvements}
Through collaboration with researchers at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, many improvements to the chemical kinetic model for \iPeOH{} were
made relative to the work of \textcite{Tsujimura2012}. Some of the major
improvements are highlighted below; see the article for more detail
\cite{Sarathy2013}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The model was restructured based on work with C$_4$ and C$_5$
      alcohols \cite{Sarathy2012, Heufer2012a}
\item The most stable conformers of \iPeOH{} were calculated using
      quantum chemistry software
\item The BDEs of the of the C-C, C-H, C-O, and O-H bonds were calculated
      using quantum chemistry software
\item The model includes the Waddington pathway shown to be important in
      low-temperature decomposition of \iPeOH{} by \textcite{Welz2012}
\item New reaction pathways were added based on the work of \textcite{Welz2012,
      Welz2013}, including the unconventional water-elimination pathway discussed
      in \textcite{Welz2013}
\end{enumerate}

Moreover, the following data sets from the literature and presented in
\cite{Sarathy2013} were used to validate the newly updated model, in
addition to the data presented here.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ignition delays measured in a shock tube \cite{Tang2013, Tsujimura2012}
\item JSR species data \cite{Dayma2011}
\item New ignition delays measured in shock tubes \cite{Sarathy2013}
\item New JSR species data \cite{Sarathy2013}
\item New flame speed and flame extinction measurements \cite{Sarathy2013}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental \& Modeling Results}
\label{sec:ipeoh-results}

The experimental ignition delays measured in the RCM are shown in
\cref{fig:ipeoh-7bar,fig:ipeoh-20bar,,fig:ipeoh-40bar}, along with
ignition delays measured in the shock tube and comparison with
the model simulations. There is no $\phi=2.0$ data set for \SI{7}{\atmosphere}
because no conditions at which ignition occurred could be found.
In \cref{fig:ipeoh-7bar,fig:ipeoh-20bar,fig:ipeoh-40bar}, solid
lines represent adiabatic, constant volume simulations, and dashed
lines represent volume-profile simulations.

At \SI{7}{\atmosphere}, the high-temperature ignition delays
are generally predicted to within a factor of 1.5. The RCM experiments
are also well predicted at low temperature---within a factor of 2---but
the disagreement grows to approximately a factor of 4 in the
intermediate temperature regime. At \SI{20}{\atmosphere}, the
high-temperature ignition delays are well predicted, including
capturing the equivalence ratio sensitivity of the ignition delays.
The ignition delays measured in the RCM are fairly well predicted
at the lean and stoichiometric condition, but are over-predicted
at the rich condition.
