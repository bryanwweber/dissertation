\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

The list of people who have contributed to this work in ways large and small
is uncountable. The list that follows is by definition incomplete
and so let me say at the top, thank you!

The first thanks must go to my advisor, Professor Chih-Jen Sung. It has
now been seven years since I started working in the Combustion Diagnostics
Laboratory and I will be eternally grateful for his faith to take a
chance on me as a research student. His consistent and constant guidance
has been more than any student could hope to have. There are no words to
express my gratitude, so a simple ``thank you'' will have to do.

My committee members Professors Baki Cetegen, Michael Renfro, Tianfeng
Lu, and Kamal Kumar deserve many thanks, first for reading this beast of
a dissertation, but primarily for providing guidance and the opportunity
to learn from them.

I need to give hearty thanks to my friends and colleagues,
including Dr. Kyle Niemeyer, Kyle Brady, Dr. Xin Hui,
Dr. Apurba Das, Goutham Kukkadapu, Nick Curtis, Xiao Ren, Justin
Bunnell, Pradeep Singh, Kathryn Gosselin, George Lapaan,
Jason Wagner, Bikram Roy Chowdhury, Martin Hawron, Marc Schneider,
Prof. Gaurav Mittal and Dr. Matthew Deans, for advice,
help, and just generally being awesome people.

My parents and family have provided all of the support I have needed in
the many years this process has taken. Their love, generosity, and the
occasional hot meal have encouraged me when I needed it and always comforted.
I am also blessed that my mother is an editor and that she was willing to read this
dissertation.

A graduate student would be sunk without the support of the staff who
\textit{actually} run the department, so to Kelly, Laurie, Jackie, Tina,
and Emily, a million thank yous! Peter Glaude and Jim Olney in the machine
shop have helped immensely with the design and fabrication of several of
the experiments conducted here, often on a very tight schedule.

Of course, the work has to be funded somehow---this work was supported as
part of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center, an Energy Frontier
Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science,
Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC0001198.

And leaving the best to the end, my wonderful fianc√©e Ali. You have helped
and inspired me through every step of this process, from the stress of
qualifiers, during the doldrums in the mid-Ph.D. stage, and finally through
the last push to finish everything. You have an amazing reservoir of patience
that never seems to be exhausted. You are the best thing that has ever
happened to me and you amaze me every day. I love you.

\noindent Thank you everyone.\\

CanSen is a Python script that I wrote to simplify the transition from
Senkin-style, input-file-based usage to the Cantera-style script-based usage.

%Pysens code
\chapter{pysens}
\label{app:pysens}
This appendix contains the code for `pysens`. `pysens` is a Python wrapper
for sensitivity analysis in CHEMKIN-Pro. This program runs a brute
force, one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis of the ignition delay for a
given mechanism. It was used to conduct the sensitivity analyses in
\cref{chap:peoh,chap:mch}.
