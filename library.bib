abstract = {Dilute concentrations of normal-butanol has been decomposed in single pulse shock tube studies in the presence of large quantities of a chemical inhibitor that suppresses contributions from chain decomposition. Reaction temperatures and pressures are in the range of [1126-1231] K and [1.3-6.5] bar. Ethylene and 1-butene are the only products. The mechanism of the initial decomposition steps involves direct elimination of water and C-C bond cleavage. The fundamental high pressure unimolecular decomposition rate expressions are k(C(4)H(9)OH → CH(3) + CH(2)CH(2)CH(2)OH) = 10(16.4±0.4) exp(42410 ± 800 [K]/T) s(-1); k(C(4)H(9)OH → CH(3)CH(2) + CH(2)CH(2)OH) = 10(16.4±0.4) exp(-41150 ± 800 [K]/T) s(-1); k(C(4)H(9)OH → CH(3)CH(2)CH(2) + CH(2)OH) = 10(16.4±0.4) exp(-41150 ± 800 [K]/T) s(-1); and k(C(4)H(9)OH → CH(3)CH(2)CH═CH(2) + H(2)O) = 10(14.0±0.4) exp(-35089 ± 800 [K]/T) s(-1), where the rate expressions for C-C bond cleavage are based on assumptions regarding the relative rates of the three processes derived from earlier studies on the effect of an OH group on rate expressions. All reactions are in the high pressure limit and suggest that the step size down in the presence of argon is at least 1300 cm(-1). These rate expressions are consistent with the following H-C bond dissociation energies: BDE(H-CH(2)CH(2)CH(2)OH) = 417.2 ± 7 kJ/mol, BDE(H-CH(2)CH(2)OH) = 419.2 ± 7 kJ/mol, and BDE(H-CH(2)OH) = 401.7 ± 9 kJ/mol, with an estimated uncertainty of 6 kJ/mol. The kinetics and thermodynamic results are compared with estimates used in the building of combustion kinetics databases.},

abstract = {Advanced biofuels produced by microorganisms have similar properties to petroleum-based fuels, and can 'drop in' to the existing transportation infrastructure. However, producing these biofuels in yields high enough to be useful requires the engineering of the microorganism's metabolism. Such engineering is not based on just one specific feedstock or host organism. Data-driven and synthetic-biology approaches can be used to optimize both the host and pathways to maximize fuel production. Despite some success, challenges still need to be met to move advanced biofuels towards commercialization, and to compete with more conventional fuels.},

abstract = {The Evaluation of Measurement Data - Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (usually referred to as the GUM) provides general rules for evaluating and expressing uncertainty in measurement. When a measurand, y, is calculated from other measurements through a functional relationship, uncertainties in the input variables will propagate through the calculation to an uncertainty in the output y. The manner in which such uncertainties are propagated through a functional relationship provides much of the mathematical challenge to fully understanding the GUM.The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of the GUM and to show how the calculation of uncertainty in the measurand may be achieved through a functional relationship. That is, starting with the general equation for combining uncertainty components as outlined in the GUM, we show how this general equation can be applied to various functional relationships in order to derive a combined standard uncertainty for the output value of the particular function (the measurand). The GUM equation may be applied to any mathematical form or functional relationship (the starting point for laboratory calculations) and describes the propagation of uncertainty from the input variable(s) to the output value of the function (the end point or outcome of the laboratory calculation). A rule-based approach is suggested with a number of the more common rules tabulated for the routine calculation of measurement uncertainty.},

abstract = {Rising petroleum costs, trade imbalances and environmental concerns have stimulated efforts to advance the microbial production of fuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Here we identify a novel biosynthetic alternative to D2 diesel fuel, bisabolane, and engineer microbial platforms for the production of its immediate precursor, bisabolene. First, we identify bisabolane as an alternative to D2 diesel by measuring the fuel properties of chemically hydrogenated commercial bisabolene. Then, via a combination of enzyme screening and metabolic engineering, we obtain a more than tenfold increase in bisabolene titers in Escherichia coli to >900 mg l(-1). We produce bisabolene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (>900 mg l(-1)), a widely used platform for the production of ethanol. Finally, we chemically hydrogenate biosynthetic bisabolene into bisabolane. This work presents a framework for the identification of novel terpene-based advanced biofuels and the rapid engineering of microbial farnesyl diphosphate-overproducing platforms for the production of biofuels.},

Agreement with experimental rate coefficients, which are quite scattered, is satisfactory. However, unexpected differences have been found between the RPMD results and those obtained from variational transition-state theory for two full-dimensional potential energy surfaces used in the calculations. Possible reasons for such discrepancy are discussed. The present work is an important step in a series of benchmark studies aimed at assessing accuracy for RPMD for chemical reaction rates, which demonstrates that this novel method is a quite reliable alternative to previously developed techniques based on transition-state theory.},

The measured activation energy (298 K-494 K) for CH2OO + alkenes is E\_a≈3500±1000 J mol\^{}(-1) for all alkyl substituted alkenes and E\_a=7000±900 J mol\^{}(-1) for ethene.

Quantum chemical calculations of the corresponding rate coefficients reproduce qualitative reactivity trends but overestimate the absolute rate coefficients. Despite the small E\_a's, the CH2OO + alkene rate coefficients are almost 2 orders of magnitude smaller than similar reactions between CH2OO and carbonyl compounds. Using the rate constants measured here, we estimate that under typical atmospheric conditions, reaction with alkenes does not represent a significant sink of CH2OO. In environments rich in C=C double bonds, however, such as ozone-exposed rubber or emission plumes, these reactions can play a significant role.},

abstract = {Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is a category of low temperature combustion (LTC), which represents a potential major advancement in high-efficiency, low-emissions engines. Although HCCI engines have been demonstrated to operate well under certain conditions, obstacles have been encountered at high-load, cold-start and during transient operating conditions. Thus, an extensive understanding of HCCI combustion is required to address technology barriers and develop valuable control strategies for HCCI engines. The study of iso-octane auto-ignition is of particular interest because iso-octane is one of the primary reference fuels that determine octane numbers. In this work, auto-ignition of iso-octane was examined using a rapid-compression facility (RCF) with iso-octane, oxygen, nitrogen and argon mixtures. The effects of HCCI conditions on the iso-octane ignition characteristics, including ignition delay time, time-resolved OH time histories, and detailed speciation at select times, were studied. Experimental results for iso-octane ignition delay times, $\tau$ ign , were obtained over a range of equivalence ratios (straight phi] = 0.25-1.0), pressures (P = 5.12-23 atm), temperatures (T = 943-1027 K), oxygen mole fractions ($\chi$O2 = 9-21\%), and with the addition of trace amounts of combustion product gases (CO2 and H2 O). The ignition delay times were well represented by the expression:Special characters omitted.] Absolute quantitative OH mole fraction time histories were obtained using differential narrow-line laser absorption of the R1 (5) line of the A2 $\Sigma$+ arrow left]X2 ∏ i (0,0) band of the OH spectrum ($\nu$o = 32606.56 cm -1 ). For these experiments, diluted iso-octane/argon/nitrogen/oxygen mixtures were used with fuel/oxygen equivalence ratios from $\phi$ = 0.25 to 0.35. The pressures and temperatures after compression ranged from 8.5 to 15 atm and from 945 to 1020 K, respectively. Intermediate species were quantified by chemically quenching the test gases in the core region at various times during the combustion process via rapid expansion into a vacuum chamber. The composition of the contents in the sampling chamber was analyzed using gas chromatography for stable species, hydrocarbons (C1-C8), and oxygenates. The speciation experiments were conducted at fuel lean ($\phi$ = 0.4) and fuel rich ($\phi$ = 1.2) conditions. The experimental results of this work provide data critical for the development of LTC engine technologies, particularly kinetically controlled HCCI engines. The data also have direct relevance to other LTC applications where the reaction kinetics affects combustion performance. Quantitative understanding of iso-octane ignition characteristics at lean, low temperature, and moderate pressure conditions can now applied with confidence.},

abstract = {The overall rate constants for the reactions of hydroxyl radicals (OH) with four small methyl esters, namely methyl formate (CH(3)OCHO), methyl acetate (CH(3)OC(O)CH(3)), methyl propanoate (CH(3)OC(O)C(2)H(5)), and methyl butanoate (CH(3)OC(O)C(3)H(7)), were investigated behind reflected shock waves using UV laser absorption of OH radicals near 306.69 nm. Test gas mixtures of individual methyl esters and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), a fast source of OH at elevated temperatures, diluted in argon were shock-heated to temperatures spanning from 876 to 1371 K at pressures near 1.5 atm. The overall rate constants were determined by matching the measured OH time-histories with the computed profiles from the comprehensive chemical kinetic mechanisms of Dooley et al. (2010) and Dooley et al. (2008), which were originally developed for the oxidation of methyl formate and methyl butanoate, respectively. These measured values can be expressed in Arrhenius form as k(CH(3)OCHO+OH) = 2.56 × 10(13) exp(-2026/T) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), k(CH(3)OC(O)CH(3)+OH) = 3.59 × 10(13) exp(-2438/T) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), k(CH(3)OC(O)C(2)H(5)+OH) = 6.65 × 10(13) exp(-2539/T) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), and k(CH(3)OC(O)C(3)H(7)+OH) = 1.13 × 10(14) exp(-2515/T) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) over the temperature ranges studied. Detailed error analyses were performed to estimate the overall uncertainties of these reactions, and the estimated (2$\sigma$) uncertainties were found to be ±29\% at 913 K and ±18\% at 1289 K for k(CH(3)OCHO+OH), ± 29\% at 930 K and ±17\% at 1299 K for k(CH(3)OC(O)CH(3)+OH), ± 25\% at 909 K and ±17\% at 1341 K for k(CH(3)OC(O)C2H(5)+OH), and ±24\% at 925 K and ±16\% at 1320 K for k(CH(3)OC(O)C(3)H(7)+OH). We believe these are the first direct high-temperature rate constant measurements for the reactions of OH with these small methyl esters. These measured rate constants were also compared with the estimated values employed in different comprehensive kinetic mechanisms. Additionally, the structure-activity relationship from Kwok and Atkinson (1995) was used to estimate these four rate constants, and the estimations from this group-additivity model are in good agreement with the measurements (within \~{}25\%) at the present experimental conditions.},

@inproceedings{Stranic2013b,
abstract = {The overall rate constant for the reaction tert-butanol + OH → products was determined experimentally behind reflected shock waves by using 18O-substituted tert-butanol (tert-butan18ol) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a fast source of 16OH. The data were acquired from 900 to 1200 K near 1.1 atm and are best fit by the Arrhenius expression 1.24 x 10-10 exp(-2501/T [K]) cm3 molecule-1 s-1. The products of the title reaction include the tert-C4H8OH radical that is known to have two major $\beta$-scission decomposition channels, one of which produces OH radicals. Experiments with the isotopically-labeled tert-butan18ol also lead to an experimental determination of the branching ratio for the $\beta$-scission pathways of the tert-C4H8OH radical by comparing the measured pseudo-first-order decay rate of 16OH in the presence of excess tert-butan16ol with the respective decay rate of 16OH in the presence of excess tert-butan18ol. The two decay rates of 16OH as a result of reactions with the two forms of tert-butanol differ by approximately a factor of five, due to the absence of 16OH-producing pathways in experiments with tert-butan18ol. This indicates that 80\% of the 16OH molecules that react with tert-butan16ol will reproduce another 16OH molecule through $\beta$-scission of the resulting tert-C4H816OH radical. 16OH mole fraction time-histories were measured using narrow-linewidth laser absorption near 307 nm. Measurements were performed at the linecenter of the R22(5.5) transition in the A-X(0,0) band of 16OH, a transition that does not overlap with any absorption features of 18OH, hence yielding a measurement of 16OH mole fraction that is insensitive to any production of 18OH.},

abstract = {Photofragmentation translational spectroscopy was used to identify the primary and secondary reaction pathways in the KrF laser (248 nm) photodissociation of chlorine azide (ClN(3)) under collision-free conditions. Both the molecular channel producing NCl (X (3)Sigma,a (1)Delta) + N(2) and the radical channel producing Cl ((2)P(J)) + N(3) were analyzed in detail. Consistent with previously reported velocity map ion imaging experiments [N. Hansen and A. M. Wodtke, J. Phys. Chem. A 107, 10608 (2003)] a bimodal translational energy distribution is seen when Cl atoms are monitored at mz = 35(Cl(+)). Momentum-matched N(3) counterfragments can be seen at mz = 42(N(3) (+)). The characteristics of the observed radical-channel data reflect the formation of linear azide radical and another high-energy form of N(3) (HEF-N(3)) that exhibits many of the characteristics one would expect from cyclic N(3). HEF-N(3) can be directly detected by electron-impact ionization more than 100 mus after its formation. Products of the unimolecular dissociation of HEF-N(3) are observed in the mz = 14(N(+)) and mz = 28(N(2) (+)) data. Anisotropy parameters were determined for the primary channels to be beta = -0.3 for the NCl forming channel and beta = 1.7 and beta = 0.4 for the linear N(3) and HEF-N(3) forming channels, respectively. There is additional evidence for secondary photodissociation of N(3) and of NCl.},

@article{Ezeji2007a,
abstract = {Butanol is produced chemically using either the oxo process starting from propylene (with H2 and CO over a rhodium catalyst) or the aldol process starting from acetaldehyde. The key problems associated with the bioproduction of butanol are the cost of substrate and butanol toxicity/inhibition of the fermenting microorganisms, resulting in a low butanol titer in the fermentation broth. Recent interest in the production of biobutanol from biomass has led to the re-examination of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, including strategies for reducing or eliminating butanol toxicity to the culture and for manipulating the culture to achieve better product specificity and yield. Advances in integrated fermentation and in situ product removal processes have resulted in a dramatic reduction of process streams, reduced butanol toxicity to the fermenting microorganisms, improved substrate utilization, and overall improved bioreactor performance.},

abstract = {Product channels for the self-reaction of the resonance-stabilized allyl radical, C3H5 + C3H5, have been studied with isomeric specificity at temperatures from 300-600 K and pressures from 1-6 Torr using time-resolved multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry. Under these conditions 1,5-hexadiene was the only C6H10 product isomer detected. The lack of isomerization of the C6H10 product is in marked contrast to the C6H6 product in the related C3H3 + C3H3 reaction, and is due to the more saturated electronic structure of the C6H10 system. The disproportionation product channel, yielding allene + propene, was also detected, with an upper limit on the branching fraction relative to recombination of 0.03. Analysis of the allyl radical decay at 298 K yielded a total rate coefficient of (2.7 +/- 0.8) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), in good agreement with previous experimental measurements using ultraviolet kinetic absorption spectroscopy and a recent theoretical determination using variable reaction coordinate transition state theory. This result provides independent indirect support for the literature value of the allyl radical ultraviolet absorption cross-section near 223 nm.},

@article{Karwat2012,
abstract = {High-speed gas sampling experiments to measure the intermediate products formed during fuel decomposition remain challenging yet important experimental objectives. This article presents new speciation data on two important fuel reference compounds, n-heptane and n-butanol, at practical thermodynamic conditions of 700 K and 9 atm, for stoichiometric fuel-to-oxygen ratios and a dilution of 5.64 (molar ratio of inert gases to O(2)), and at two blend ratios, 80\%-20\% and 50\%-50\% by mole of n-heptane and n-butanol, respectively. When compared against 100\% n-heptane ignition results, the experimental data show that n-butanol slows the reactivity of n-heptane. In addition, speciation results of n-butanol concentrations show that n-heptane causes n-butanol to react at temperatures where n-butanol in isolation would not be considered reactive. The chemical kinetic mechanism developed for this work accurately predicts the trends observed for species such as carbon monoxide, methane, propane, 1-butene, and others. However, the mechanism predicts a higher amount of n-heptane consumed at the first stage of ignition compared to the experimental data. Consequently, many of the species concentration predictions show a sharp rise at the first stage of ignition, a trend that is not observed experimentally. An important discovery is that the presence of n-butanol reduces the measured concentrations of the large linear alkenes, including heptenes, hexenes, and pentenes, showing that the addition of n-butanol affects the fundamental chemical pathways of n-heptane during ignition.},

@article{Huynh2008,
abstract = {An increased necessity for energy independence and heightened concern about the effects of rising carbon dioxide levels have intensified the search for renewable fuels that could reduce our current consumption of petrol and diesel. One such fuel is biodiesel, which consists of the methyl esters of fatty acids. Methyl butanoate (MB) contains the essential chemical structure of the long-chain fatty acids and a shorter, but similar, alkyl chain. This paper reports on a detailed kinetic mechanism for MB that is assembled using theoretical approaches. Thirteen pathways that include fuel decomposition, isomerization, and propagation steps were computed using ab initio calculations [J. Org. Chem. 2008, 73, 94]. Rate constants from first principles for important reactions in CO(2) formation, namely CH(3)OCO=CH(3) + CO(2) (R1) and CH(3)OCO=CH(3)O + CO (R2) reactions, are computed at high levels of theory and implemented in the mechanism. Using the G3B3 potential energy surface together with the B3LYP/6-31G(d) gradient, Hessian and geometries, the rate constants for reactions R1 and R2 are calculated using the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory with corrections from treatments for tunneling, hindered rotation, and variational effects. The calculated rate constants of reaction R1 differ from the data present in the literature by at most 20\%, while those of reaction R2 are about a factor of 4 lower than the available values. The new kinetic model derived from ab initio simulations is combined with the kinetic mechanism presented by Fisher et al. [Proc. Combust. Inst. 2000, 28, 1579] together with the addition of the newly found six-centered unimolecular elimination reaction that yields ethylene and methyl acetate, MB = C(2)H(4) + CH(3)COOCH(3). This latter pathway requires the inclusion of the CH(3)COOCH(3) decomposition model suggested by Westbrook et al. [Proc. Combust. Inst. 2008, accepted]. The newly composed kinetic mechanism for MB is used to study the CO(2) formation during the pyrolysis of MB as well as to investigate the autoignition of MB in a shock tube reactor at different temperatures and pressures. The computed results agree very well with experimental data present in the literature. Sensitivity and flux (rate-of-production) analyses are carried out for the CO(2) formation with the new MB mechanism, together with available reaction mechanisms, to assess the importance of various kinetic pathways for each regime. With the new mechanism, the flux analyses for the formation of C(2)H species, one of the most important species for ignition delay time, are also presented at different conditions. In addition to giving a better chemical insight of the pyrolysis/oxidation of MB, the results suggest ways to improve the mechanism's capability to predict CO(2) formation and ignition delay times in pyrolysis and oxidation conditions.},

abstract = {The photoionization of alkylperoxy radicals has been investigated using a newly developed experimental apparatus that combines the tunability of the vacuum ultraviolet radiation of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with time-resolved mass spectrometry. Methylperoxy (CH(3)OO) and ethylperoxy (C(2)H(5)OO) radicals are produced by the reaction of pulsed, photolytically produced alkyl radicals with molecular oxygen, and the mass spectrum of the reacting mixture is monitored in time by using synchrotron-photoionization with a double-focusing mass spectrometer. The kinetics of product formation is used to confirm the origins and assignments of ionized species. The photoionization efficiency curve for CH(3)OO has been measured, and an adiabatic ionization energy of (10.33 +/- 0.05) eV was determined with the aid of Franck-Condon spectral simulations, including ionization to the lowest triplet and singlet cation states. Using the appearance energy of CH(3)(+) from CH(3)OO, an enthalpy of formation for CH(3)OO of Delta(f) (CH(3)OO) = (22.4 +/- 5) kJ mol(-1) is derived. The enthalpy of formation of CH(3)OO(+) is derived as Delta(f) = (1019 +/- 7) kJ mol(-1) and the CH(3)(+)-OO bond energy as (CH(3)(+) - O(2)) = (80 +/- 7) kJ mol(-1). The C(2)H(5)OO(+) signal is not detectable; however, the time profile of the ethyl cation signal suggests its formation from dissociative ionization of C(2)H(5)OO. Electronic structure calculations suggest that hyperconjugation reduces the stability of the ethylperoxy cation, making the C(2)H(5)OO(+) ground state only slightly bound with respect to the ground-state products, C(2)H(5)(+) and O(2). The value of the measured appearance energy of C(2)H(5)(+) is consistent with dissociative ionization of C(2)H(5)OO via the Franck-Condon favored ionization to the \~{a} (1)A' state of C(2)H(5)OO(+).},

abstract = {We present a sequence of n-tuple-zeta augmented polarized (nZaP) basis sets designed for extrapolations of both self-consistent field (SCF) and correlation energies to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. These nZaP basis sets (n=2-6) are formulated to give consistent errors throughout the Periodic Table (e.g., a consistent of approximately 1 mhartree/electron error for the 2ZaP SCF energy and a consistent of approximately 1.4 muhartree/electron error for the 6ZaP SCF energy). The SCF energy exhibits systematic convergence to the CBS limit: E(SCF)(nZaP) approximately E(SCF)(CBS)+Ae(-an). A single parameter, a=6.30, describes the 2ZaP through 6ZaP errors of H through Xe within 10\%. The SCF rms basis set truncation errors of H through Xe are 33.5mE(h), 4.58mE(h), 0.82mE(h), 0.18mE(h), and 0.047mE(h) for 2ZaP, 3ZaP, 4ZaP, 5ZaP, and 6ZaP, respectively. Linear extrapolations of the (2,3)ZaP, (3,4)ZaP, (4,5)ZaP, and (5,6)ZaP calculations (all with a=6.30) reduce these errors by an order of magnitude to 0.24mE(h), 0.056mE(h), 0.020mE(h), and 0.005mE(h), respectively. A test set of 34 atoms, ions, and molecules gives similar results, and the associated test set of 25 chemical energy differences also gives comparable absolute accuracy. However, the cancellation of errors between reactant and product is lost by extrapolation. As a result, these chemical energy differences show a more modest two-to-fourfold improvement with extrapolation.},

abstract = {Measurements of surface reflectance of permanently shadowed areas near Mercury's north pole reveal regions of anomalously dark and bright deposits at 1064 nm wavelength. These reflectance anomalies are concentrated on poleward-facing slopes and are spatially collocated with areas of high radar backscatter postulated to be the result of near-surface water ice. Correlation of observed reflectance with modeled temperatures indicates that the optically bright regions are consistent with surface water ice, whereas dark regions are consistent with a surface layer of complex organic material that likely overlies buried ice and provides thermal insulation. Impacts of comets or volatile-rich asteroids could have provided both the dark and bright deposits.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray binaries are stellar systems containing a neutron star or black hole, with gamma-ray emission produced by an interaction between the components. These systems are rare, even though binary evolution models predict dozens in our Galaxy. A search for gamma-ray binaries with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) shows that 1FGL J1018.6-5856 exhibits intensity and spectral modulation with a 16.6-day period. We identified a variable x-ray counterpart, which shows a sharp maximum coinciding with maximum gamma-ray emission, as well as an O6V((f)) star optical counterpart and a radio counterpart that is also apparently modulated on the orbital period. 1FGL J1018.6-5856 is thus a gamma-ray binary, and its detection suggests the presence of other fainter binaries in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {The quasi-quantum treatment (QQT) (Gijsbertsen et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2006, 128, 8777) provides a physically compelling framework for the evaluation of rotationally inelastic scattering, including the differential cross sections (DCS). In this work the QQT framework is extended to treat the DCS in the classically forbidden region as well as the classically allowed region. Most importantly, the QQT is applied to the collision energy dependence of the angular distributions of these DCSs. This leads to an analytical formalism that reveals a scaling relationship between the DCS calculated at a particular collision energy and the DCS at other collision energies. This scaling is shown to be exact for QM calculated or experimental DCSs if the magnitude of the (kinematic apse frame) underlying scattering amplitude depends solely on the projection of the incoming momentum vector onto the kinematic apse vector. The QM DCSs of the NO(X)-He collision system were found to obey this scaling law nearly perfectly for energies above 63 meV. The mathematical derivation is accompanied by a mechanistic description of the Feynman paths that contribute to the scattering amplitude in the classically allowed and forbidden regions, and the nature of the momentum transfer during the collision process. This scaling relationship highlights the nature of (and limits to) the information that is obtainable from the collision-energy dependence of the DCS, and allows a description of the relevant angular range of the DCSs that embodies this information.},

abstract = {The recently developed high-accuracy extrapolated ab initio thermochemistry method for theoretical thermochemistry, which is intimately related to other high-precision protocols such as the Weizmann-3 and focal-point approaches, is revisited. Some minor improvements in theoretical rigor are introduced which do not lead to any significant additional computational overhead, but are shown to have a negligible overall effect on the accuracy. In addition, the method is extended to completely treat electron correlation effects up to pentuple excitations. The use of an approximate treatment of quadruple and pentuple excitations is suggested; the former as a pragmatic approximation for standard cases and the latter when extremely high accuracy is required. For a test suite of molecules that have rather precisely known enthalpies of formation \{as taken from the active thermochemical tables of Ruscic and co-workers [Lecture Notes in Computer Science, edited by M. Parashar (Springer, Berlin, 2002), Vol. 2536, pp. 25-38; J. Phys. Chem.

Uncertainties of laminar flame velocity, maximal flame temperature, and maximal concentrations of radicals H, O, OH, CH, and CH(2) were investigated. Global uncertainty analysis methods included the Morris method, the Monte Carlo analysis with Latin hypercube sampling, and an improved version of the Sobol' method. Assumed probability density functions (pdf's) were assigned to the rate coefficients of all the 175 reactions and to the enthalpies of formation of the 37 species. The analyses provided the following answers: approximate pdf's and standard deviations of the model results, minimum and maximum values of the results at any physically realistic parameter combination, and the contribution of the uncertainty of each parameter to the uncertainty of the model result. The uncertainty of a few rate parameters and a few enthalpies of formation causes most of the uncertainty of the model results. Most uncertainty comes from the inappropriate knowledge of kinetic data, but the uncertainty caused by thermodynamic data is also significant.},

Two new thermochemical group values are suggested in this paper, and with these values, the group additivity method for calculation of enthalpy as implemented in reaction mechanism generator (RMG) gives good agreement with CBS-QB3 predictions.

We investigated various butanol production systems with high density of living cells of Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 supplemented with methyl viologen (MV) as an electron carrier and nutrient dosing for activity regeneration. In continuous butanol production with high density of living cells, butanol yield was drastically increased from 0.365 C-mol/C-mol with growing cells to 0.528 C-mol/C-mol at a dilution rate of 0.85 h⁻¹, being increased with the butanol to total solvent ratio. This yield was increased to 0.591 C-mol/C-mol by adding 0.01 mM MV. MV addition increased not only butanol yield but also butanol concentration and productivity as compared to those without MV addition. However, living cells lost their activity with incubation time, which lowered the operational stability of the system. Therefore, to maintain constant stability, activity regeneration was carried out with high density of living cells and MV. This system produced butanol at high concentration (9.40 g l⁻¹) and productivity (7.99 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹) for approximately 100 h with maintenance of considerably high yield of butanol (0.686 C-mol/C-mol). Thus, we established a high-speed and highly efficient butanol production system.},

The experiments combine flame-sampling molecular-beam mass spectrometry with photoionization by tunable vacuum-UV synchrotron radiation. The theoretical simulations employ the rovibrational properties obtained with B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) density functional theory and electronic energies obtained from QCISD(T) electronic structure calculations extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. For C(5)H(3), the comparison reveals the presence of both the H(2)CCCCCH (i-C(5)H(3)) and the HCCCHCCH (n-C(5)H(3)) isomer. The simulations also suggest a modest amount of cyclo-CCHCHCCH-, which is consistent with a minor signal for C(5)H(2) that is apparently due to cyclo-CCHCCCH-. For C(5)H(4), contributions from the CH(2)CCCCH(2) (1,2,3,4-pentatetraene), CH(2)CCHCCH, and CH(3)CCCCH (1,3-pentadiyne) isomers are evident, as is some contribution from CHCCH(2)CCH (1,4-pentadiyne) in the cyclopentene and benzene flames. Signal at m/z = 65 originates mainly from the cyclopentadienyl radical. For C(5)H(6), contributions from cyclopentadiene, CH(3)CCCHCH(2), CH(3)CHCHCCH, and CH(2)CHCH(2)CCH are observed. No signal is observed for C(5)H(7) species. Cyclopentene, CH(2)CHCHCHCH(3) (1,3-pentadiene), CH(3)CCCH(2)CH(3) (2-pentyne), and CH(2)CHCH(2)CHCH(2) (1,4-pentadiene) contribute to the signal at m/z = 68. Newly derived ionization energies for i- and n-C(5)H(3) (8.20 +/- 0.05 and 8.31 +/- 0.05 eV, respectively), CH(2)CCHCCH (9.22 +/- 0.05 eV), and CH(2)CHCH(2)CCH (9.95 +/- 0.05 eV) are within the error bars of the QCISD(T) calculations. The combustion chemistry of the observed C(5)H(x) intermediates and the impact on flame chemistry models are discussed.},

abstract = {The kinetics of the reaction of molecular oxygen with hydroperoxyalkyl radicals have been studied theoretically. These reactions, often referred to as second O(2) addition, or O(2) + QOOH reactions, are believed to be responsible for low-temperature chain branching in hydrocarbon oxidation. The O(2) + propyl system was chosen as a model system. High-level ab initio calculations of the C(3)H(7)O(2) and C(3)H(7)O(4) potential energy surfaces are coupled with RRKM master equation methods to compute the temperature and pressure dependence of the rate coefficients. Variable reaction coordinate transition-state theory is used to characterize the barrierless transition states for the O(2) + QOOH addition reactions as well as subsequent C(3)H(6)O(3) dissociation reactions. A simple kinetic mechanism is developed to illustrate the conditions under which the second O(2) addition increases the number of radicals. The sequential reactions O(2) + QOOH → OOQOOH → OH + keto-hydroperoxide → OH + OH + oxy-radical and the corresponding formally direct (or well skipping) reaction O(2) + QOOH → OH + OH + oxy-radical increase the total number of radicals. Chain branching through this reaction is maximized in the temperature range 600-900 K for pressures between 0.1 and 10 atm. The results confirm that n-propyl is the smallest alkyl radical to exhibit the low-temperature combustion properties of larger alkyl radicals, but n-butyl is perhaps a truer combustion archetype.},

abstract = {Reactions of alkyl radicals with oxygen are key reactions in the low-temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons, but they have not been extensively studied yet in the case of cycloalkanes. Isomerizations of cycloalkylperoxy radicals and formation of cyclic ethers are especially important. In the present work, a theoretical study of the gas-phase reactions of cyclopentylperoxy and cyclohexylperoxy radicals has been carried out by means of quantum chemical calculations at the CBS-QB3 level. Computations on cyclopentylperoxy decomposition pathways are reported here for the first time. Thermochemical data have been obtained by means of isodesmic reactions, and the contribution of hindered rotors has been explicitly taken into account. Transition state theory has been used to calculate rate constants for all the elementary reactions. Three-parameter Arrhenius expressions have been derived in the temperature range 300-1000 K. Tunneling effects have been accounted for in the case of H-atom transfers. Our results compare well with experimental data and previous calculations available in the literature. In particular, the predicted rate constants for processes involving cyclohexylperoxy radicals, which have been introduced in a reaction mechanism scheme proposed before, exhibit excellent agreement with experiments at low and intermediate temperatures.},

@article{Jalan2013a,
abstract = {Detailed kinetic models provide useful mechanistic insight into a chemical system. Manual construction of such models is laborious and error-prone, which has led to the development of automated methods for exploring chemical pathways. These methods rely on fast, high-throughput estimation of species thermochemistry and kinetic parameters. In this paper, we present a methodology for extending automatic mechanism generation to solution phase systems which requires estimation of solvent effects on reaction rates and equilibria. The linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) method of Abraham and co-workers is combined with Mintz correlations to estimate $\Delta$G(solv)°(T) in over 30 solvents using solute descriptors estimated from group additivity. Simple corrections are found to be adequate for the treatment of radical sites, as suggested by comparison with known experimental data. The performance of scaled particle theory expressions for enthalpic-entropic decomposition of $\Delta$G(solv)°(T) is also presented along with the associated computational issues. Similar high-throughput methods for solvent effects on free-radical kinetics are only available for a handful of reactions due to lack of reliable experimental data, and continuum dielectric calculations offer an alternative method for their estimation. For illustration, we model liquid phase oxidation of tetralin in different solvents computing the solvent dependence for ROO• + ROO• and ROO• + solvent reactions using polarizable continuum quantum chemistry methods. The resulting kinetic models show an increase in oxidation rate with solvent polarity, consistent with experiment. Further work needed to make this approach more generally useful is outlined.},

abstract = {The rate constant for the overall reaction OH + 1-butanol → products was determined in the temperature range 900 to 1200 K from measurements of OH concentration time histories in reflected shock wave experiments of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a fast source of OH radicals with 1-butanol in excess. Narrow-linewidth laser absorption was employed for the quantitative OH concentration measurement. A detailed kinetic mechanism was constructed that includes updated rate constants for 1-butanol and TBHP kinetics that influence the near-first-order OH concentration decay under the present experimental conditions, and this mechanism was used to facilitate the rate constant determination. The current work improves upon previous experimental studies of the title rate constant by utilizing a rigorously generated kinetic model to describe secondary reactions. Additionally, the current work extends the temperature range of experimental data in the literature for the title reaction under combustion-relevant conditions, presenting the first measurements from 900 to 1000 K. Over the entire temperature range studied, the overall rate constant can be expressed in Arrhenius form as 3.24 × 10(-10) exp(-2505/T [K]) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The influence of secondary reactions on the overall OH decay rate is discussed, and a detailed uncertainty analysis is performed yielding an overall uncertainty in the measured rate constant of ±20\% at 1197 K and ±23\% at 925 K. The results are compared with previous experimental and theoretical studies on the rate constant for the title reaction and reasonable agreement is found when the earlier experimental data were reinterpreted.},

abstract = {Production of chemicals and fuels directly from CO(2) is an attractive approach to solving the energy and environmental problems. 1-Butanol, a chemical feedstock and potential fuel, has been produced by fermentation of carbohydrates, both in native Clostridium species and various engineered hosts. To produce 1-butanol from CO(2), we transferred a modified CoA-dependent 1-butanol production pathway into a cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We demonstrated the activity of each enzyme in the pathway by chromosomal integration and expression of the genes. In particular, Treponema denticola trans-enoyl-CoA reductase (Ter), which utilizes NADH as the reducing power, was used for the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA instead of Clostridium acetobutylicum butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase to by-pass the need of Clostridial ferredoxins. Addition of polyhistidine-tag increased the overall activity of Ter and resulted in higher 1-butanol production. Removal of oxygen is an important factor in the synthesis of 1-butanol in this organism. This result represents the first autotrophic 1-butanol production.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis, principal component analysis of the sensitivity matrix, and rate-of-production analysis are useful tools in interpreting detailed chemical kinetics calculations. This paper deals with the practical use and communication of the sensitivity analysis and the related methods are discussed. Some limitations of sensitivity analysis, originating from the mathematical concept (e.g. first-order or brute force methods) or from the software-specific implementation of the method, are discussed. As supplementary tools to the current methods, three novel visual tools for analysis of detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms are introduced: (a) scaled sensitivity analysis which is especially suited for studying initiation reactions where the span of reaction rates is high; (b) automated generation of reaction pathway plots which provides an immediate graphical illustration of the chemical processes occurring; (c) explorative (or chemometric) analysis of accumulated rate of progress matrices which assist in the identification of reaction subsets. The application of these tools are demonstrated by analysing NOx enhanced oxidation of methane at 700-1200 K.},

abstract = {Five isomerization reactions involving intramolecular hydrogen-transfer in butoxyl radicals have been studied using variational transition state theory with small curvature tunneling. A set of best estimates of barrier heights and reaction energies for these five reactions was obtained by using coupled cluster theory including single and double excitations with a quasiperturbative treatment of connected triple excitations and a basis set extrapolated to the complete basis set limit plus core-valence correlation contributions and scalar relativistic corrections. This work predicts high-pressure limiting rate constants of these five reactions over the temperature range 200-2500 K and clarifies the available experimental data from indirect measurements. This study shows the importance of performing rate calculations with proper accounting for tunneling and torsional anharmonicity. We also proposed two new models for use in fitting rate constants over wide ranges of temperature.},

abstract = {Nature uses a limited set of metabolites to perform all of the biochemical reactions. To increase the metabolic capabilities of biological systems, we have expanded the natural metabolic network, using a nonnatural metabolic engineering approach. The branched-chain amino acid pathways are extended to produce abiotic longer chain keto acids and alcohols by engineering the chain elongation activity of 2-isopropylmalate synthase and altering the substrate specificity of downstream enzymes through rational protein design. When introduced into Escherichia coli, this nonnatural biosynthetic pathway produces various long-chain alcohols with carbon number ranging from 5 to 8. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by optimizing the biosynthesis of the 6-carbon alcohol, (S)-3-methyl-1-pentanol. This work demonstrates an approach to build artificial metabolism beyond the natural metabolic network. Nonnatural metabolites such as long chain alcohols are now included in the metabolite family of living systems.},

abstract = {Measurements of the composition of reaction intermediates in low-pressure premixed flat flames of three simple esters, the methyl butanoate (MB), methyl isobutanoate (MIB), and ethyl propanoate (EP) isomers of C(5)H(10)O(2), enable further refinement and validation of a detailed chemical reaction mechanism originally developed in modeling studies of similar flames of methyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl formate, and ethyl acetate. Photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS), using monochromated synchrotron radiation, reveals significant differences in the compositions of key reaction intermediates between flames of the MB, MIB, and EP isomers studied under identical flame conditions. Detailed kinetic modeling describes how these differences are related to molecular structures of each of these isomers, leading to unique fuel destruction pathways. Despite the simple structures of these small esters, they contain structural functional groups expected to account for fuel-specific effects observed in the combustion of practical biodiesel fuels. The good agreement between experimental measurements and detailed reaction mechanisms applicable to these simple esters demonstrates that major features of each flame can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by building a hierarchical reaction mechanism based on three factors: (1) unimolecular decomposition of the fuel, especially by complex bond fission; (2) H-atom abstraction reactions followed by $\beta$-scission of the resulting radicals, leading to nearly all of the intermediate species observed in each flame; (3) the rates of H-atom abstraction reactions for each alkoxy or alkyl group (i.e., methoxy, ethoxy, methyl, ethyl, propyl) are effectively the same as in other ester fuels with the same structural groups.},

abstract = {A common origin for the Moon and Earth is required by their identical isotopic composition. However, simulations of the current giant impact hypothesis for Moon formation find that most lunar material originated from the impactor, which should have had a different isotopic signature. Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth's mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report a detailed analysis of the breakdown kinetic mechanism for methyl butanoate (MB) using theoretical approaches. Electronic structures and structure-related molecular properties of reactants, intermediates, products, and transition states were explored at the BH\&HLYP/cc-pVTZ level of theory. Rate constants for the unimolecular and bimolecular reactions in the temperature range of 300-2500 K were calculated using Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus and transition state theories, respectively. Thirteen pathways were identified leading to the formation of small compounds such as CH(3), C(2)H(3), CO, CO(2), and H(2)CO. For the initial formation of MB radicals, H, CH(3), and OH were considered as reactive radicals participating in hydrogen abstraction reactions. Kinetic simulation results for a high temperature pyrolysis environment show that MB radicals are mainly produced through hydrogen abstraction reactions by H atoms. In addition, the C(O)OCH(3) = CO + CH(3)O reaction is found to be the main source of CO formation. The newly computed kinetic sub-model for MB breakdown is recommended as a core component to study the combustion of oxygenated species.},

abstract = {The overall rate constant for the reaction of OH with sec-butanol [CH(3)CH(OH)CH(2)CH(3)] was determined from measurements of the near-first-order OH decay in shock-heated mixtures of tert-butylhydroperoxide (as a fast source of OH) with sec-butanol in excess. Three kinetic mechanisms from the literature describing sec-butanol combustion were used to examine the sensitivity of the rate constant determination to secondary kinetics. The overall rate constant determined can be described by the Arrhenius expression 6.97 × 10(-11) exp(-1550/T[K]) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), valid over the temperature range of 888-1178 K. Uncertainty bounds of ±30\% were found to adequately account for the uncertainty in secondary kinetics. To our knowledge, the current data represent the first efforts toward an experimentally determined rate constant for the overall reaction of OH with sec-butanol at combustion-relevant temperatures. A rate constant predicted using a structure-activity relationship from the literature was compared to the current data and previous rate constant measurements for the title reaction at atmospheric-relevant temperatures. The structure-activity relationship was found to be unable to correctly predict the measured rate constant at all temperatures where experimental data exist. We found that the three-parameter fit of 4.95 × 10(-20)T(2.66) exp(+1123/T[K]) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) better describes the overall rate constant for the reaction of OH with sec-butanol from 263 to 1178 K.},

@article{Xu2012,
abstract = {We investigate the statistical thermodynamics and kinetics of the 1,5-hydrogen shift isomerization reaction of the 1-butoxyl radical and its reverse isomerization. The partition functions and thermodynamic functions (entropy, enthalpy, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy) are calculated using the multi-structural torsional (MS-T) anharmonicity method including all structures for three species (reactant, product, and transition state) involved in the reaction. The calculated thermodynamic quantities have been compared to those estimated by the empirical group additivity (GA) method. The kinetics of the unimolecular isomerization reaction was investigated using multi-structural canonical variational transition state theory (MS-CVT) including both multiple-structure and torsional (MS-T) anharmonicity effects. In these calculations, multidimensional tunneling (MT) probabilities were evaluated by the small-curvature tunneling (SCT) approximation and compared to results obtained with the zero-curvature tunneling (ZCT) approximation. The high-pressure-limit rate constants for both the forward and reverse reactions are reported as calculated by MS-CVT/MT, where MT can be ZCT or SCT. Comparison with the rate constants obtained by the single-structural harmonic oscillator (SS-HO) approximation shows the importance of anharmonicity in the rate constants of these reactions, and the effect of multi-structural anharmonicity is found to be very large. Whereas the tunneling effect increases the rate constants, the MS-T anharmonicity decreases them at all temperatures. The two effects counteract each other at temperatures 385 K and 264 K for forward and reverse reactions, respectively, and tunneling dominates at lower temperatures while MS-T anharmonicity has a larger effect at higher temperatures. The multi-structural torsional anharmonicity effect reduces the final reverse reaction rate constants by a much larger factor than it does to the forward ones as a result of the existence of more low-energy structures of the product 4-hydroxy-1-butyl radical than the reactant 1-butoxyl radical. As a consequence there is also a very large effect on the equilibrium constant. The neglect of multi-structural anharmonicity will lead to large errors in the estimation of reverse reaction rate constants.},

abstract = {Density functional and ab initio calculations at CBS-QB3 levels of theory were employed with a series of isodesmic reactions to determine the thermochemistry of the 2-oxopropyl or acetonyl radical (CH(3)COC*H2). In turn, this was used to determine formation enthalpies of 2-oxoethyl or formylmethyl (C*H(2)CHO), 2-oxobutyl (C*H(2)COC(2)H(5)), 1-methyl-2-oxopropyl or methylacetonyl (C*H(CH(3))COCH(3)), 1-methyl-2-oxobutyl (C*H(CH(3))COC(2)H(5)), and 3-oxopentyl (C*H(2)CH2COC(2)H(5)). Our computed standard enthalpy of formation of -34.9 +/- 1.9 kJ mol-1 and a resonance stabilization energy of approximately 22 kJ mol(-1) for acetonyl are in good agreement with recent re-determinations, which have indicated a substantial lowering in the long-established value for DeltaH(f)o (298.15 K). A bond dissociation energy of 401 kJ mol(-1) is suggested for the C-H bond in acetone with consistent values for the others. The calculations support the enthalpy of formation of acetaldehyde obtained from combustion experiments of -166.1 kJ mol(-1) rather than the figure of -170.7 kJ mol(-1) extracted from enthalpies of reduction and, in addition, serve to reduce the uncertainty in DeltaH(f)o the 2-oxoethyl radical to +13 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1).},

abstract = {The rate coefficient for the reaction of the ethynyl radical (C(2)H) with 1-butyne (H-C[triple bond]C-CH(2)-CH(3)) is measured in a pulsed Laval nozzle apparatus. Ethynyl radicals are formed by laser photolysis of acetylene (C(2)H(2)) at 193 nm and detected via chemiluminescence (C(2)H + O(2) --> CH (A(2)Delta) + CO(2)). The rate coefficients are measured over the temperature range of 74-295 K. The C(2)H + 1-butyne reaction exhibits no barrier and occurs with rate constants close to the collision limit. The temperature-dependent rate coefficients can be fit within experimental uncertainties by the expression k = (2.4 +/- 0.5) x 10(-10)(T/295 K)(-(0.04+/-0.03)) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). Reaction products are detected at room temperature (295 K) and 533 Pa using a multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometer (MPIMS) coupled to the tunable vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation from the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Two product channels are identified for this reaction: m/z = 64 (C(5)H(4)) and m/z = 78 (C(6)H(6)) corresponding to the CH(3)-loss and H-loss channels, respectively. Photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves are used to analyze the isomeric composition of both product channels. The C(5)H(4) products are found to be exclusively linear isomers composed of ethynylallene and methyldiacetylene in a 4:1 ratio. In contrast, the C(6)H(6) product channel includes two cyclic isomers, fulvene 18(+/-5)\% and 3,4-dimethylenecyclobut-1-ene (DMCB) 32(+/-8)\%, as well as three linear isomers, 2-ethynyl-1,3-butadiene 8(+/-5)\%, 3,4-hexadiene-1-yne 28(+/-8)\%, and 1,3-hexadiyne 14(+/-5)\%. Within experimental uncertainties, we do not see appreciable amounts of benzene and an upper limit of 10\% is estimated. Diacetylene (C(4)H(2)) formation via the C(2)H(5)-loss channel is also thermodynamically possible but cannot be observed due to experimental limitations. The implications of these results for modeling of planetary atmospheres, especially of Saturn's largest moon Titan and the relationships to combustion reactions, are discussed.},

abstract = {Temperature and concentration fields have been investigated in the cylindrical combustion chamber of a rapid compression machine (RCM) by schlieren photography, chemiluminescent imaging and planar laser induced fluorescence of acetone and of formaldehyde in a 2-dimensional sheet across the diameter. The timescale of particular interest was up to 10 ms after the piston has stopped. Experiments were performed in non-reactive and reactive conditions. Acetone was seeded in non-reactive mixtures. Combustion was studied first in a system containing di-tert-butyl peroxide vapour in the presence of oxygen. The decomposition of di-tert-butyl peroxide generates methyl radicals, which are then oxidised if oxygen is present. The overall reaction is exothermic and is characteristic of a conventional thermal ignition. In addition, chemiluminescence, resulting from CH2O*, accompanies the oxidation process. The combustion of n-pentane was then investigated at compressed gas temperatures that spanned the range in which there is a negative temperature dependence of the overall reaction rate, typically 750-850 K. The response to thermal feedback in this more complex thermokinetic system can be the opposite of the "thermal runaway" that accompanies di-tert-butyl peroxide combustion. The purpose of making comparisons between these two types of systems was to show how the temperature field generated in the RCM is modified in different ways by the interaction with the chemistry and to discuss the implications of this for the spatial development of spontaneous ignition. As the piston of the RCM moves it shears gas off the walls of the chamber. This probably creates a roll-up vortex, but more importantly it also collects gas from the walls and moves it across the cylinder head pushing it forward into a plug at the centre. Thus, soon after the end of compression there is an adiabatically heated gas which extends virtually to the wall, but this incorporates a plug of colder gas at its core. Diffusive transport will occur, but the timescale is relatively slow, and the effect hardly shows until at least 10 ms post-compression. The consequence of "thermal runaway" on a timescale that is compatible with the development of this temperature field is that the reaction rate in the adiabatically compressed toroidal region accelerates faster than in the core, and goes to completion first. A somewhat similar pattern emerges during n-pentane combustion when the initial condition is set at the lower end of the negative temperature dependent range. By contrast, at adiabatically compressed gas temperatures close to the upper end of the negative temperature dependent region, the reaction rate in the cooler core develops faster than that in the surrounding zone, and the temperature difference is rapidly smoothed out. This does not lead to spatial homogeneity in all respects, however, because different rates and extents of reaction generate different concentrations of intermediates. This stratification has implications for the eventual spatial evolution of spontaneous ignition.},

abstract = {The gas-phase reaction of benzene with O((3)P) is of considerable interest for modeling of aromatic oxidation, and also because there exist fundamental questions concerning the prominence of intersystem crossing in the reaction. While its overall rate constant has been studied extensively, there are still significant uncertainties in the product distribution. The reaction proceeds mainly through the addition of the O atom to benzene, forming an initial triplet diradical adduct, which can either dissociate to form the phenoxy radical and H atom or undergo intersystem crossing onto a singlet surface, followed by a multiplicity of internal isomerizations, leading to several possible reaction products. In this work, we examined the product branching ratios of the reaction between benzene and O((3)P) over the temperature range 300-1000 K and pressure range 1-10 Torr. The reactions were initiated by pulsed-laser photolysis of NO(2) in the presence of benzene and helium buffer in a slow-flow reactor, and reaction products were identified by using the multiplexed chemical kinetics photoionization mass spectrometer operating at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Phenol and phenoxy radical were detected and quantified. Cyclopentadiene and cyclopentadienyl radical were directly identified for the first time. Finally, ab initio calculations and master equation/RRKM modeling were used to reproduce the experimental branching ratios, yielding pressure-dependent rate expressions for the reaction channels, including phenoxy + H, phenol, cyclopentadiene + CO, which are proposed for kinetic modeling of benzene oxidation.},

abstract = {A restricted-open-shell model chemistry based on the complete basis set-quadratic Becke3 (CBS-QB3) model is formulated and denoted ROCBS-QB3. As the name implies, this method uses spin-restricted wave functions, both for the direct calculations of the various components of the electronic energy and for extrapolating the correlation energy to the complete-basis-set limit. These modifications eliminate the need for empirical corrections that are incorporated in standard CBS-QB3 to compensate for spin contamination when spin-unrestricted wave functions are used. We employ an initial test set of 19 severely spin-contaminated species including doublet radicals and both singlet and triplet biradicals. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) from experiment for the new ROCBS-QB3 model (3.6+/-1.5 kJ mol(-1)) is slightly smaller than that of the standard unrestricted CBS-QB3 version (4.8+/-1.5 kJ mol(-1)) and substantially smaller than the MAD for the unrestricted CBS-QB3 before inclusion of the spin correction (16.1+/-1.5 kJ mol(-1)). However, when applied to calculate the heats of formation at 298 K for the moderately spin-contaminated radicals in the G2/97 test set, ROCBS-QB3 does not perform quite as well as the standard unrestricted CBS-QB3, with a MAD from experiment of 3.8+/-1.6 kJ mol(-1) (compared with 2.9+/-1.6 kJ mol(-1) for standard CBS-QB3). ROCBS-QB3 performs marginally better than standard CBS-QB3 for the G2/97 set of ionization energies with a MAD of 4.1+/-0.1 kJ mol(-1) (compared with 4.4+/-0.1 kJ mol(-1)) and electron affinities with a MAD of 3.9+/-0.2 kJ mol(-1) (compared with 4.3+/-0.2 kJ mol(-1)), but the differences in MAD values are comparable to the experimental uncertainties. Our overall conclusion is that ROCBS-QB3 eliminates the spin correction in standard CBS-QB3 with no loss in accuracy.},

abstract = {Butanol, an alcohol which can be produced from biomass sources, has received recent interest as an alternative to gasoline for use in spark ignition engines and as a possible blending compound with fossil diesel or biodiesel. Therefore, the autoignition of the four isomers of butanol (1-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol, and tert-butanol) has been experimentally studied at high temperatures in a shock tube, and a kinetic mechanism for description of their high-temperature oxidation has been developed. Ignition delay times for butanol/oxygen/argon mixtures have been measured behind reflected shock waves at temperatures and pressures ranging from approximately 1200 to 1800 K and 1 to 4 bar. Electronically excited OH emission and pressure measurements were used to determine ignition-delay times. The influence of temperature, pressure, and mixture composition on ignition delay has been characterized. A detailed kinetic mechanism has been developed to describe the oxidation of the butanol isomers and validated by comparison to the shock-tube measurements. Reaction flux and sensitivity analysis illustrates the relative importance of the three competing classes of consumption reactions during the oxidation of the four butanol isomers: dehydration, unimolecular decomposition, and H-atom abstraction. Kinetic modeling indicates that the consumption of 1-butanol and iso-butanol, the most reactive isomers, takes place primarily by H-atom abstraction resulting in the formation of radicals, the decomposition of which yields highly reactive branching agents, H atoms and OH radicals. Conversely, the consumption of tert-butanol and 2-butanol, the least reactive isomers, takes place primarily via dehydration, resulting in the formation of alkenes, which lead to resonance stabilized radicals with very low reactivity. To our knowledge, the ignition-delay measurements and oxidation mechanism presented here for 2-butanol, iso-butanol, and tert-butanol are the first of their kind.},

abstract = {We consider an alternative formulation of the master equation for complex-forming chemical reactions with multiple wells and bimolecular products. Within this formulation the dynamical phase space consists of only the microscopic populations of the various isomers making up the reactive complex, while the bimolecular reactants and products are treated equally as sources and sinks. This reformulation yields compact expressions for the phenomenological rate coefficients describing all chemical processes, i.e., internal isomerization reactions, bimolecular-to-bimolecular reactions, isomer-to-bimolecular reactions, and bimolecular-to-isomer reactions. The applicability of the detailed balance condition is discussed and confirmed. We also consider the situation where some of the chemical eigenvalues approach the energy relaxation time scale and show how to modify the phenomenological rate coefficients so that they retain their validity.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a practical data-driven method to discriminate among large-scale kinetic reaction models. The approach centers around a computable measure of model/data mismatch. We introduce two provably convergent algorithms that were developed to accommodate large ranges of uncertainty in the model parameters. The algorithms are demonstrated on a simple toy example and a methane combustion model with more than 100 uncertain parameters. They are subsequently used to discriminate between two models for a contemporarily studied biological signaling network.},

abstract = {The formation of HO(2) in the reactions of C(2)H(5), n-C(3)H(7), and i-C(3)H(7) radicals with O(2) is investigated using the technique of laser photolysis/long-path frequency-modulation spectroscopy. The alkyl radicals are formed by 266 nm photolysis of alkyl iodides. The formation of HO(2) from the subsequent reaction of the alkyl radicals with O(2) is followed by infrared frequency-modulation spectroscopy. The concentration of I atoms is simultaneously monitored by direct absorption of a second laser probe on the spin-orbit transition. The measured profiles are compared to a kinetic model taken from time-resolved master-equation results based on previously published ab initio characterizations of the relevant stationary points on the potential-energy surface. The ab initio energies are adjusted to produce agreement with the present experimental data and with available literature studies. The isomer specificity of the present results enables refinement of the model for i-C(3)H(7) + O(2) and improved agreement with experimental measurements of HO(2) production in propane oxidation.},

abstract = {The thermal rate coefficients and kinetic isotope effects have been calculated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) for the prototypical reactions between methane and several hydrogen isotopes (H, D, and Mu). The excellent agreement with the theoretical rate coefficients of the H + CH4 reaction obtained previously from a multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree calculation on the same potential energy surface provides strong evidence for the accuracy of the RPMD approach. These quantum mechanical rate coefficients are also in good agreement with the results obtained previously using the transition-state theory with semi-classical tunneling corrections for the H∕D + CH4 reactions. However, it is shown that the RPMD rate coefficients for the ultralight Mu reaction with CH4 are significantly smaller than the experimental data, presumably suggesting inaccuracies in the potential energy surface and∕or experimental errors. Significant discrepancies between the RPMD and transition-state theory results have also been found for this challenging system.},

@article{DaSilva2009,
abstract = {Bioethanol is currently a significant gasoline additive and the major blend component of flex-fuel formulations. Ethanol is a high-octane fuel component, and vehicles designed to take advantage of higher octane fuel blends could operate at higher compression ratios than traditional gasoline engines, leading to improved performance and tank-to-wheel efficiency. There are significant uncertainties, however, regarding the mechanism for ethanol autoignition, especially at lower temperatures such as in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime. We have studied an important chemical process in the autoignition and oxidation of ethanol, reaction of the alpha-hydroxyethyl radical with O2(3P), using first principles computational chemistry, variational transition state theory, and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM)/master equation simulations. The alpha-hydroxyethyl + O2 association reaction is found to produce an activated alpha-hydroxy-ethylperoxy adduct with ca. 37 kcal mol(-1) of excess vibrational energy. This activated adduct predominantly proceeds to acetaldehyde + HO(2), with smaller quantities of the enol vinyl alcohol (ethenol), particularly at higher temperatures. The reaction to acetaldehyde + HO2 proceeds with such a low barrier that collision stabilization of C2O3H5 isomers is unimportant, even for high-pressure/low-temperature conditions. The short lifetimes of these radicals precludes the chain-branching addition of a second O2 molecule, responsible for NTC behavior in alkane autoignition. This result helps to explain why ignition delays for ethanol are longer than those for ethane, despite ethanol having a weaker C-C bond energy. Given its relative instability, it is also unlikely that the alpha-hydroxy-ethylperoxy radical acts as a major acetaldehyde sink in the atmosphere, as has been suggested.},

abstract = {The kinetics of oxidation of kerosene Jet A-1 and a kerosene/rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) mixture (80/20, mol/mol) (biokerosene) was studied experimentally in a jet-stirred reactor at 10 atm and constant residence time, over the temperature range 740-1200 K, and for variable equivalence ratios (0.5-1.5). Concentration profiles of the reactants, stable intermediates, and final products were obtained by probe sampling followed by on-line and off-line gas chromatography analyses. The oxidation of these fuels in these conditions was modeled using a detailed kinetic reaction mechanism consisting of 2027 reversible reactions and 263 species. The surrogate biokerosene model fuel used here consisted of a mixture of n-hexadecane, n-propylcyclohexane, n-propylbenzene, and n-decane, where the long-chain methyl ester fraction was simply represented by n-hexadecane. The proposed kinetic reaction mechanism used in the modeling yielded a good representation of the kinetics of oxidation of kerosene and biokerosene under jet-stirred reactor conditions and of kerosene in a premixed flame. The data and the model showed the biokerosene (Jet A-1/RME mixture) has a slightly higher reactivity than Jet A-1, whereas no major modification of the product distribution was observed besides the formation of small unsaturated methyl esters produced from RME's oxidation. The model predicts no difference in the ignition delays of kerosene and biokerosene. Using the proposed kinetic scheme, the formation of potential soot precursors was studied with particular attention.},

For the alkanes C(n)H(2n+2) with n = 2 --> 4, the reactions are investigated at the CCSD(T) level in the correlation-consistent triple-zeta (cc-pVTZ) basis. The results are adjusted to the benchmark methane reaction and compared with those from other approaches that are commonly used in the field such as CBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, and density functional theory. Rate constants are computed in the framework of transition state theory, and the results are compared with previous values available.},

abstract = {Interest in biobutanol, a sustainable vehicle fuel, is increasing due to rising oil prices and concerns of surrounding climate change and the energy crisis. However, the costs of biobutanol with conventional ABE fermentation by Clostridium are higher than the cost of butanol from today's petrochemical processes. Two major problems in the economic production of biobutanol are difficulty controlling the induction of a metabolic shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis and limitations imposed by severe product inhibition. With developments in biotechnology, and the completion of genome sequencing of Clostridium, genetic modification is a viable method to improve the solvent yield and the butanol production ratio. The present article aims to highlight the latest research progress on overexpressing, inserting, knocking out, and knocking down genes of the key enzymes in the ABE fermentation pathway and other relative genes (such as genes coding for heat-shock proteins, operon, transcription, etc). Recombinant manipulations of these genes in Escherichiacoli and yeast have also been reported recently, although their butanol yields are lower than in Clostridium. Butanol production with solventogenic clostridia from various feedstocks is also evaluated in this review.},

abstract = {Due to the world's over-reliance on fossil fuels there has been a developing interest in the production of renewable biofuels such as methyl and ethyl esters derived from vegetable oils and animal fats. To increase our understanding of the combustion chemistry of esters, the oxidation of methyl butanoate and ethyl propanoate, both with a molecular formula of C5H10O2, have been studied in a series of high-temperature shock tube experiments. Ignition delay times for a series of mixtures, of varying fuel/oxygen equivalence ratios (phi = 0.25-1.5), were measured behind reflected shock waves over the temperature range 1100-1670 K, and at pressures of 1.0, and 4.0 atm. It was found that ethyl propanoate was consistently faster to ignite than methyl butanoate, particularly at lower temperatures. Detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms have been assembled and used to simulate these experiments with good agreement observed. Rate of production analyses using the detailed mechanisms shows that the faster reactivity of ethyl propanoate can be explained by a six-centered unimolecular decomposition reaction with a relatively low activation energy barrier producing propanoic acid and ethylene. The elimination reaction itself is not responsible for the increased reactivity; it is the faster reactivity of the two products, propanoic acid and ethylene that leads to this behavior.},

A comparison of RPMD with previous theoretical results obtained using transition state theory shows that RPMD is a more reliable theoretical approach for systems with more than 6 atoms, which provides a predictable level of accuracy. We show that the success of RPMD is a direct result of its independence of the choice of transition state dividing surface, a feature that is not shared by any of the transition state theory-based methods. Our results demonstrate that RPMD is a prospective method for studies of KIEs for polyatomic reactions for which rigorous quantum mechanical calculations are currently impossible.},

@article{Jasper2011a,
abstract = {Ensembles of classical trajectories are used to study collisional energy transfer in highly vibrationally excited CH(4) for eight bath gases. Several simplifying assumptions for the CH(4) + M interaction potential energy surface are tested against full dimensional direct dynamics trajectory calculations for M = He, Ne, and H(2). The calculated energy transfer averages are confirmed to be sensitive to the shape of the repulsive wall of the intermolecular potential, with an exponential repulsive wall required for quantitative predictions. For the diatomic baths, the usual "separable pairwise" approximation for the interaction potential is unable to describe the orientation dependence of the interaction potential accurately, and the ambiguity in the resulting parametrizations contributes an additional uncertainty to the predicted energy transfer averages of 20-40\%. On the other hand, the energy transfer averages are shown to be insensitive to the level of theory used to describe the intramolecular CH(4) potential, with a computationally efficient semiempirical tight binding potential for hydrocarbons performing equally well as an MP2 potential. The relative collisional energy transfer efficiencies of the eight bath gases are discussed and shown to be a function of temperature. The ensemble-averaged energy transferred in deactivating collisions <$\Delta$E(d)> for each bath is used to parametrize a single-exponential-down model for collisional energy transfer in master equation calculations. The predicted decomposition rate coefficients for CH(4) agree well with available experimental rate coefficients for M = He, Ar, Kr, and CH(4). The effect of vibrational anharmonicity on the predicted rate coefficients is considered briefly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The field of DNA-encoded technology offers a cutting edge approach to creating 10(9) - 10(12)-size small molecule libraries for the rapid identification of drug-like hits. The YoctoReactor(®) (yR) is the newest DNA-encoded technology and features an innovative and fundamentally different design.

OBJECTIVE: This technology evaluation presents the basic principles of the yR drug discovery technology platform and discusses its potential as an alternative to current hit discovery methods where high quality and selective drug-like hits can be delivered together with instant structure activity relationships (SAR).

CONCLUSION: The yR controls and encodes billions of different synthesis combinatorially through self-assembly of DNA into three-dimensional DNA junctions. The center of these junctions forms a yoctoliter (10(-24) L) volume reactor where single-molecule, DNA- encoded reactions can take place. yR technology circumvents the high throughput screening process (HTS). Instead, drug-like families of hits are rapidly identified by molecular evolution in a single tube approach making it highly parallelizable and scalable. DNA-encoded technologies such as the yR, therefore, represent a solution to many of the bottlenecks in current early phase discovery and in handling the vast emerging opportunities in functional genomics, systems biology and proteomics.},

abstract = {Carbonyl oxide species play a key role in tropospheric oxidation of organic molecules and in low-temperature combustion processes. In the late 1940s, Criegee first postulated the participation of carbonyl oxides, now often called "Criegee intermediates," in ozonolysis of alkenes. However, despite decades of effort, no gas phase Criegee intermediate has before been observed. As a result, knowledge of gas phase carbonyl oxide reactions has heretofore been inferred by indirect means, with derived rate coefficients spanning orders of magnitude. We have directly detected the primary Criegee intermediate, formaldehyde oxide (CH2OO), in the chlorine-initiated gas-phase oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This work not only establishes that the Criegee intermediate is formed in DMSO oxidation also but opens the possibility for explicit kinetics studies on this critical atmospheric species.},

abstract = {Biofuels synthesized from renewable resources are of increasing interest because of global energy and environmental problems. We have previously demonstrated production of higher alcohols from Escherichia coli using a 2-keto acid-based pathway. Here, we took advantage of the growth phenotype associated with 2-keto acid deficiency to construct a hyperproducer of 1-propanol and 1-butanol by evolving citramalate synthase (CimA) from Methanococcus jannaschii. This new pathway, which directly converts pyruvate to 2-ketobutyrate, bypasses threonine biosynthesis and represents the shortest keto acid-mediated pathway for producing 1-propanol and 1-butanol from glucose. Directed evolution of CimA enhanced the specific activity over a wide temperature range (30 to 70 degrees C). The best CimA variant was found to be insensitive to feedback inhibition by isoleucine in addition to the improved activity. This CimA variant enabled 9- and 22-fold higher production levels of 1-propanol and 1-butanol, respectively, compared to the strain expressing the wild-type CimA. This work demonstrates (i) the first production of 1-propanol and 1-butanol using the citramalate pathway and (ii) the benefit of the 2-keto acid pathway that enables a growth-based evolutionary strategy to improve the production of non-growth-related products.},

abstract = {We report a detailed theoretical study of the hydrogen abstraction reaction from methanol by atomic hydrogen. The study includes the analysis of thermal rate constants, branching ratios, and kinetic isotope effects. Specifically, we have performed high-level computations at the MC3BB level together with direct dynamics calculations by canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) with the microcanonically optimized multidimensional tunneling ($\mu$OMT) transmission coefficient (CVT/$\mu$OMT) to study both the CH(3)OH+H→CH(2)OH+H(2) (R1) reaction and the CH(3)OH+H→CH(3)O+H(2) (R2) reaction. The CVT/$\mu$OMT calculations show that reaction R1 dominates in the whole range 298≤T (K)≤2500 and that anharmonic effects on the torsional mode about the C-O bond are important, mainly at high temperatures. The activation energy for the total reaction sum of R1 and R2 reactions changes substantially with temperature and, therefore, the use of straight-line Arrhenius plots is not valid. We recommend the use of new expressions for the total R1 + R2 reaction and for the R1 and R2 individual reactions.},

High-level ab initio calculations of ionization energies for C2nH2 (n=1-5) and partially hydrogenated CnH4 (n=7-8) polyynes are compared with photoionization efficiency measurements in flames fuelled by allene, propyne, and cyclopentene. C2nH2 (n=1-5) intermediates are unambiguously identified, while HC[triple bond, length as m-dash]C-C[triple bond, length as m-dash]C-CH=C=CH2, HC[triple bond, length as m-dash]C-C[triple bond, length as m-dash]C-C[triple bond, length as m-dash]C-CH=CH2 (vinyltriacetylene) and HC[triple bond, length as m-dash]C-C[triple bond, length as m-dash]C-CH[double bond, length as m-dash]CH-C[triple bond, length as m-dash]CH are likely to contribute to the C7H4 and C8H4 signals. Mole fraction profiles as a function of distance from the burner are presented. C7H4 and C8H4 isomers are likely to be formed by reactions of C2H and C4H radicals but other plausible formation pathways are also discussed. Heats of formation and ionization energies of several combustion intermediates have been determined for the first time.},

abstract = {For the first time, nascent soot particles are probed by using helium-ion microscopy (HIM). HIM is a technique that is similar to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) but it can achieve higher contrast and improved surface sensitivity, especially for carbonaceous materials. The HIM microscope yields images with a high contrast, which allows for the unambiguous recognition of smaller nascent soot particles than those observed in previous transmission electron microscopy studies. The results indicate that HIM is ideal for rapid and reliable probing of the morphology of nascent soot, with surface details visible down to approximately 5 nm, and particles as small as 2 nm are detectable. The results also show that nascent soot is structurally and chemically inhomogeneous, and even the smallest particles can have shapes that deviate from a perfect sphere.},

These thermochemical quantities are calculated from recently proposed methods for calculating partition functions of complex molecules by taking into account their multiple conformational structures and torsional anharmonicity. The radicals considered in this study are those obtained by hydrogen abstraction from 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, and butanal. Electronic structure calculations for all conformers of the radicals were carried out using both density functional theory and explicitly correlated coupled cluster theory with quasipertubative inclusion of connected triple excitations. The heat capacity and entropy results are compared with sparsely available group additivity data, and trends in enthalpy and free energy as a function of radical center are discussed for the isomeric radicals.},

abstract = {The OH concentration in the Cl-initiated oxidation of cyclohexane has been measured between 6.5-20.3 bar and in the 586-828 K temperature range by a pulsed-laser photolytic initiation-laser-induced fluorescence method. The experimental OH profiles are modeled by using a master-equation-based kinetic model as well as a comprehensive literature mechanism. Below approximately 700 K OH formation takes place on two distinct time-scales, one on the order of microseconds and the other over milliseconds. Detailed modeling demonstrates that "formally direct" chemical activation pathways are responsible for the OH formation on short timescales. These results establish that formally direct pathways are surprisingly important even for relatively large molecules at the pressures of practical combustors. It is also shown that remaining discrepancies between model and experiment are attributable to low-temperature chain branching from the addition of the "second oxygen" to hydroperoxycyclohexyl radicals.},

Here, we report a method to store electrical energy as chemical energy in higher alcohols, which can be used as liquid transportation fuels. We genetically engineered a lithoautotrophic microorganism, Ralstonia eutropha H16, to produce isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol in an electro-bioreactor using CO(2) as the sole carbon source and electricity as the sole energy input. The process integrates electrochemical formate production and biological CO(2) fixation and higher alcohol synthesis, opening the possibility of electricity-driven bioconversion of CO(2) to commercial chemicals.},

abstract = {The depleting petroleum storage and increasing environmental deterioration are threatening the sustainable development of human societies. As such, biofuels and chemical feedstocks generated from renewable sources are becoming increasingly important. Although previous efforts led to great success in bio-ethanol production, higher alcohols, fatty acid derivatives including biodiesels, alkanes, and alkenes offer additional advantages because of their compatibility with existing infrastructure. In addition, some of these compounds are useful chemical feedstocks. Since native organisms do not naturally produce these compounds in high quantities, metabolic engineering becomes essential in constructing producing organisms. In this article, we briefly review the four major metabolic systems, the coenzyme-A mediated pathways, the keto acid pathways, the fatty acid pathway, and the isoprenoid pathways, that allow production of these fuel-grade chemicals.},

Surviving fragments of projectiles in the lunar regolith provide a direct measure of the types and thus the sources of exogenous material delivered to the Earth-Moon system. In ancient [>3.4 billion years ago (Ga)] regolith breccias from the Apollo 16 landing site, we located mineral and lithologic relics of magnesian chondrules from chondritic impactors. These ancient impactor fragments are not nearly as diverse as those found in younger (3.4 Ga to today) regolith breccias and soils from the Moon or that presently fall as meteorites to Earth. This suggests that primitive chondritic asteroids, originating from a similar source region, were common Earth-Moon-crossing impactors during the latter stages of the basin-forming epoch.},

abstract = {The reaction of hydroxyl (OH) radicals with 1,3-butadiene (C(4)H(6)) was studied behind reflected shock waves over the temperature range 1011-1406 K and at pressures near 2.2 atm. OH radicals were produced by shock-heating tert-butyl hydroperoxide, (CH(3))(3)-CO-OH, and were monitored by narrow line width ring dye laser absorption of the well-characterized R(1)(5) line of the OH A-X (0,0) band near 306.7 nm. OH time histories were modeled using a comprehensive 1,3-butadiene oxidation mechanism, and rate constants for the reaction of OH with 1,3-butadiene were extracted by matching modeled and measured OH concentration time histories. Detailed error analyses yielded an uncertainty estimate of +/-13\% at 1200 K for the rate coefficient of the target reaction. The current data extends the temperature range of the only previous high-temperature study for this reaction. The rate coefficient and the branching fractions for the H-abstraction channels of the target reaction were also calculated over the temperature range 250-2500 K using variational transition-state theory based on QCISD(T)/cc-pVinfinityZ//B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) quantum chemistry. The calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results above 1200 K.},

abstract = {Graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) are used extensively as instructors in higher education, yet their status and authority as teachers may be unclear to undergraduates, to administrators, and even to the GTAs themselves. This study explored undergraduate perception of classroom instruction by GTAs and professors to identify factors unique to each type of instructor versus the type of classes they teach. Data collection was via an online survey composed of subscales from two validated instruments, as well as one open-ended question asking students to compare the same class taught by a professor versus a GTA. Quantitative and qualitative results indicated that some student instructional perceptions are specific to instructor type, and not class type. For example, regardless of type of class, professors are perceived as being confident, in control, organized, experienced, knowledgeable, distant, formal, strict, hard, boring, and respected. Conversely, GTAs are perceived as uncertain, hesitant, nervous, relaxed, laid-back, engaging, interactive, relatable, understanding, and able to personalize teaching. Overall, undergraduates seem to perceive professors as having more knowledge and authority over the curriculum, but enjoy the instructional style of GTAs. The results of this study will be used to make recommendations for GTA professional development programs.},

@article{Hansen2011a,
abstract = {An automated reaction mechanism generator is used to develop a predictive, comprehensive reaction mechanism for the high-temperature oxidation chemistry of n-butanol. This new kinetic model is an advancement of an earlier model, which had been extensively tested against earlier experimental data (Harper et al., Combust. Flame, 2011, 158, 16-41). In this study, the model's predictive capabilities are improved by targeting isomer-resolved quantitative mole fraction profiles of flame species in low-pressure flames. To this end, a total of three burner-stabilized premixed flames are isomer-selectively analyzed by flame-sampling molecular-beam time-of-flight mass spectrometry using photoionization by tunable vacuum-ultraviolet synchrotron radiation. For most species, the newly developed chemical kinetic model is capable of accurately reproducing the experimental trends in these flames. The results clearly indicate that n-butanol is mainly consumed by H-atom abstraction with H, O, and OH, forming predominantly the $\alpha$-C(4)H(9)O radical (CH(3)CH(2)CH(2)˙CHOH). Fission of C-C bonds in n-butanol is only predicted to be significant in a similar, but hotter flame studied by O\ss wald et al. (Combust. Flame, 2011, 158, 2-15). The water-elimination reaction to 1-butene is found to be of no importance under the premixed conditions studied here. The initially formed isomeric C(4)H(9)O radicals are predicted to further oxidize by reacting with H and O(2) or to decompose to smaller fragments via $\beta$-scission. Enols are detected experimentally, with their importance being overpredicted by the model.},

abstract = {We report Cl((2)P(3/2)) and Cl*((2)P(1/2)) fragment images following ClN(3) photolysis in the 234-280 nm region measured by velocity map imaging. Kinetic energy distributions change shape with photolysis wavelength from bimodal at 234 and 240 nm to single peak at 266 and 280 nm. Where two peaks exist, their ratio is significantly different for Cl and Cl* fragments. The single peak of 266 and 280 nm and the faster peak at 234 and 240 nm are assigned to a Cl + linear-N(3) dissociation channel, in agreement with previous work. The slow peak in the bimodal distributions is assigned to the formation of a high energy form (HEF) of N(3). Candidates for the identity of HEF-N(3) are discussed. Combining our data with photofragmentation translational spectroscopy results, we determined the threshold for the appearance of HEF-N(3) at 4.83 +/- 0.17 eV photolysis energy. This threshold behavior is similar to recently reported results on the wavelength dependence of HN(3) photolysis, where the threshold was associated with a ring closed isomer of HN(3) on the S(1) potential energy surface. We also note that the HEF-N(3) formation threshold observed for ClN(3) occurs where the energy available to the products equals the isomerization barrier from linear to cyclic-N(3).},

abstract = {Production of higher alcohols via the keto-acid intermediates found in microorganism's native amino-acid pathways has recently shown promising results. In this work, an Escherichia coli strain that produces 1-butanol and 1-propanol from glucose was constructed. The strain first converts glucose to 2-ketobutyrate, a common keto-acid intermediate for isoleucine biosynthesis. Then, 2-ketobutyrate is converted to 1-propanol through reactions catalyzed by the heterologous decarboxylase and dehydrogenase, or to 1-butanol via the chemistry involved in the synthesis of the unnatural amino acid norvaline. We systematically improved the synthesis of 1-propanol and 1-butanol through deregulation of amino-acid biosynthesis and elimination of competing pathways. The final strain demonstrated a production titer of 2 g/L with nearly 1:1 ratio of butanol and propanol.},

@article{Jalan2013,
abstract = {We present new reaction pathways relevant to low-temperature oxidation in gaseous and condensed phases. The new pathways originate from $\gamma$-ketohydroperoxides (KHP), which are well-known products in low-temperature oxidation and are assumed to react only via homolytic O-O dissociation in existing kinetic models. Our ab initio calculations identify new exothermic reactions of KHP forming a cyclic peroxide isomer, which decomposes via novel concerted reactions into carbonyl and carboxylic acid products. Geometries and frequencies of all stationary points are obtained using the M06-2X/MG3S DFT model chemistry, and energies are refined using RCCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12 single-point calculations. Thermal rate coefficients are computed using variational transition-state theory (VTST) calculations with multidimensional tunneling contributions based on small-curvature tunneling (SCT). These are combined with multistructural partition functions (Q(MS-T)) to obtain direct dynamics multipath (MP-VTST/SCT) gas-phase rate coefficients. For comparison with liquid-phase measurements, solvent effects are included using continuum dielectric solvation models. The predicted rate coefficients are found to be in excellent agreement with experiment when due consideration is made for acid-catalyzed isomerization. This work provides theoretical confirmation of the 30-year-old hypothesis of Korcek and co-workers that KHPs are precursors to carboxylic acid formation, resolving an open problem in the kinetics of liquid-phase autoxidation. The significance of the new pathways in atmospheric chemistry, low-temperature combustion, and oxidation of biological lipids are discussed.},

abstract = {The branched C(5) alcohol isopentanol (3-methylbutan-1-ol) has shown promise as a potential biofuel both because of new advanced biochemical routes for its production and because of its combustion characteristics, in particular as a fuel for homogeneous-charge compression ignition (HCCI) or related strategies. In the present work, the fundamental autoignition chemistry of isopentanol is investigated by using the technique of pulsed-photolytic Cl-initiated oxidation and by analyzing the reacting mixture by time-resolved tunable synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry in low-pressure (8 Torr) experiments in the 550-750 K temperature range. The mass-spectrometric experiments reveal a rich chemistry for the initial steps of isopentanol oxidation and give new insight into the low-temperature oxidation mechanism of medium-chain alcohols. Formation of isopentanal (3-methylbutanal) and unsaturated alcohols (including enols) associated with HO(2) production was observed. Cyclic ether channels are not observed, although such channels dominate OH formation in alkane oxidation. Rather, products are observed that correspond to formation of OH via$\beta$-C-C bond fission pathways of QOOH species derived from $\beta$- and $\gamma$-hydroxyisopentylperoxy (RO(2)) radicals. In these pathways, internal hydrogen abstraction in the RO(2)⇄ QOOH isomerization reaction takes place from either the -OH group or the C-H bond in $\alpha$-position to the -OH group. These pathways should be broadly characteristic for longer-chain alcohol oxidation. Isomer-resolved branching ratios are deduced, showing evolution of the main products from 550 to 750 K, which can be qualitatively explained by the dominance of RO(2) chemistry at lower temperature and hydroxyisopentyl decomposition at higher temperature.},

Several groups have demonstrated the feasibility of manipulating microbes to produce molecules similar to petroleum-derived products, albeit at relatively low productivity (e.g. maximum butanol production is around 20 g/L). For cost-effective production of biofuels, the fuel-producing hosts and pathways must be engineered and optimized. Advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology will provide new tools for metabolic engineers to better understand how to rewire the cell in order to create the desired phenotypes for the production of economically viable biofuels.},

abstract = {The inclusion of Quantum Mechanical (QM) effects such as zero point energy (ZPE) and tunneling in simulations of chemical reactions, especially in the case of light atom transfer, is an important problem in computational chemistry. In this respect, the hydrogen exchange reaction and its isotopic variants constitute an excellent benchmark for the assessment of approximate QM methods. In particular, the recently developed ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) technique has been demonstrated to give very good results for bimolecular chemical reactions in the gas phase. In this work, we have performed a detailed RPMD study of the H + H(2) reaction and its isotopologues Mu + H(2), D + H(2) and He$\mu$ + H(2), at temperatures ranging from 200 to 1000 K. Thermal rate coefficients and kinetic isotope effects have been computed and compared with exact QM calculations as well as with quasiclassical trajectories and experiment. The agreement with the QM results is good for the heaviest isotopologues, with errors ranging from 15\% to 45\%, and excellent for Mu + H(2), with errors below 15\%. We have seen that RPMD is able to capture the ZPE effect very accurately, a desirable feature of any method based on molecular dynamics. We have also verified Richardson and Althorpe's prediction [J. O. Richardson and S. C. Althorpe, J. Chem. Phys., 2009, 131, 214106] that RPMD will overestimate thermal rates for asymmetric reactions and underestimate them for symmetric reactions in the deep tunneling regime. The ZPE effect along the reaction coordinate must be taken into account when assigning the reaction symmetry in the multidimensional case.},

@article{Li2010,
abstract = {The objective of a global sensitivity analysis is to rank the importance of the system inputs considering their uncertainty and the influence they have upon the uncertainty of the system output, typically over a large region of input space. This paper introduces a new unified framework of global sensitivity analysis for systems whose input probability distributions are independent and/or correlated. The new treatment is based on covariance decomposition of the unconditional variance of the output. The treatment can be applied to mathematical models, as well as to measured laboratory and field data. When the input probability distribution is correlated, three sensitivity indices give a full description, respectively, of the total, structural (reflecting the system structure) and correlative (reflecting the correlated input probability distribution) contributions for an input or a subset of inputs. The magnitudes of all three indices need to be considered in order to quantitatively determine the relative importance of the inputs acting either independently or collectively. For independent inputs, these indices reduce to a single index consistent with previous variance-based methods. The estimation of the sensitivity indices is based on a meta-modeling approach, specifically on the random sampling-high dimensional model representation (RS-HDMR). This approach is especially useful for the treatment of laboratory and field data where the input sampling is often uncontrolled.},

@article{Hurley2009,
abstract = {Smog chamber/FTIR techniques were used to determine rate constants of k(Cl+n-butanol) = (2.21 +/- 0.38) x 10(-10) and k(OH+n-butanol) = (8.86 +/- 0.85) x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) in 700 Torr of N(2)/O(2) diluent at 296 +/- 2K. The sole primary product identified from the Cl atom initiated oxidation of n-butanol in the absence of NO was butyraldehyde (38 +/- 2\%, molar yield). The primary products of the Cl atom initiated oxidation of n-butanol in the presence of NO were (molar yield) butyraldehyde (38 +/- 2\%), propionaldehyde (23 +/- 3\%), acetaldehyde (12 +/- 4\%), and formaldehyde (33 +/- 3\%). The substantially lower yields of propionaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde as primary products in experiments conducted in the absence of NO suggests that chemical activation is important in the atmospheric chemistry of CH(3)CH(2)CH(O)CH(2)OH and CH(3)CH(O)CH(2)CH(2)OH alkoxy radicals. The primary products of the OH radical initiated oxidation of n-butanol in the presence of NO were (molar yields) butyraldehyde (44 +/- 4\%), propionaldehyde (19 +/- 2\%), and acetaldehyde (12 +/- 3\%). In all cases, the product yields were independent of oxygen concentration over the partial pressure range of 10-600 Torr. The yields of propionaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde quoted above were not corrected for secondary formation via oxidation of higher aldehydes and should be treated as upper limits. The reactions of Cl atoms and OH radicals with n-butanol proceed 38 +/- 2 and 44 +/- 4\%, respectively, via attack on the alpha-position to give an alpha-hydroxy alkyl radical which reacts with O(2) to give butyraldehyde. The results are discussed with respect to the atmospheric chemistry of n-butanol.},

@article{Cacuci2004,
abstract = {Part II of this review paper highlights the salient features of the most popular statistical methods currently used for local and global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of both large-scale computational models and indirect experimental measurements. These statistical procedures represent sampling-based methods (random sampling, stratified importance sampling, and Latin Hypercube sampling), first- and second-order reliability algorithms (FORM and SORM, respectively), variance-based methods (correlation ratio-based methods, the Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, and the Sobol Method), and screening design methods (classical one-at-a-time experiments, global one-at-a-time design methods, systematic fractional replicate designs, and sequential bifurcation designs). It is emphasized that all statistical uncertainty and sensitivity analysis procedures first commence with the 'uncertainty analysis' stage and only subsequently proceed to the 'sensitivity analysis' stage; this path is the exact reverse of the conceptual path underlying the methods of deterministic sensitivity and uncertainty analysis where the sensitivities are determined prior to using them for uncertainty analysis. By comparison to deterministic methods, statistical methods for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are relatively easier to develop and use but cannot yield exact values of the local sensitivities. Furthermore, current statistical methods have two major inherent drawbacks as follows: 1. Since many thousands of simulations are needed to obtain reliable results, statistical methods are at best expensive (for small systems) or, at worst, impracticable (e.g., for large time-dependent systems).2. Since the response sensitivities and parameter uncertainties are inherently and inseparably amalgamated in the results produced by these methods, improvements in parameter uncertainties cannot be directly propagated to improve response uncertainties; rather, the entire set of simulations and statistical postprocessing must be repeated anew. In particular, a 'fool-proof' statistical method for correctly analyzing models involving highly correlated parameters does not seem to exist currently, so that particular care must be used when interpreting regression results for such models.By addressing computational issues and particularly challenging open problems and knowledge gaps, this review paper aims at providing a comprehensive basis for further advancements and innovations in the field of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis.},

abstract = {The reactions of CH(3)OH with the HO(2) and CH(3) radicals are important in the combustion of methanol and are prototypes for reactions of heavier alcohols in biofuels. The reaction energies and barrier heights for these reaction systems are computed with CCSD(T) theory extrapolated to the complete basis set limit using correlation-consistent basis sets, both augmented and unaugmented, and further refined by including a fully coupled treatment of the connected triple excitations, a second-order perturbative treatment of quadruple excitations (by CCSDT(2)(Q)), core-valence corrections, and scalar relativistic effects. It is shown that the M08-HX and M08-SO hybrid meta-GGA density functionals can achieve sub-kcal mol(-1) agreement with the high-level ab initio results, identifying these functionals as important potential candidates for direct dynamics studies on the rates of these and homologous reaction systems.},

@article{Taatjes2006,
abstract = {The reactions of alkyl radicals (R) with molecular oxygen (O(2)) are critical components in chemical models of tropospheric chemistry, hydrocarbon flames, and autoignition phenomena. The fundamental kinetics of the R + O(2) reactions is governed by a rich interplay of elementary physical chemistry processes. At low temperatures and moderate pressures, the reactions form stabilized alkylperoxy radicals (RO(2)), which are key chain carriers in the atmospheric oxidation of hydrocarbons. At higher temperatures, thermal dissociation of the alkylperoxy radicals becomes more rapid and the formation of hydroperoxyl radicals (HO(2)) and the conjugate alkenes begins to dominate the reaction. Internal isomerization of the RO(2) radicals to produce hydroperoxyalkyl radicals, often denoted by QOOH, leads to the production of OH and cyclic ether products. More crucially for combustion chemistry, reactions of the ephemeral QOOH species are also thought to be the key to chain branching in autoignition chemistry. Over the past decade, the understanding of these important reactions has changed greatly. A recognition, arising from classical kinetics experiments but firmly established by recent high-level theoretical studies, that HO(2) elimination occurs directly from an alkylperoxy radical without intervening isomerization has helped resolve tenacious controversies regarding HO(2) formation in these reactions. Second, the importance of including formally direct chemical activation pathways, especially for the formation of products but also for the formation of the QOOH species, in kinetic modeling of R + O(2) chemistry has been demonstrated. In addition, it appears that the crucial rate coefficient for the isomerization of RO(2) radicals to QOOH may be significantly larger than previously thought. These reinterpretations of this class of reactions have been supported by comparison of detailed theoretical calculations to new experimental results that monitor the formation of products of hydrocarbon radical oxidation following a pulsed-photolytic initiation. In this article, these recent experiments are discussed and their contributions to improving general models of alkyl + O(2) reactions are highlighted. Finally, several prospects are discussed for extending the experimental investigations to the pivotal questions of QOOH radical chemistry.},

abstract = {A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism has been developed and used to study the oxidation of cyclohexane at both low and high temperatures. Rules for reaction rate constants are developed for the low-temperature combustion of cyclohexane. These rules can be used for in chemical kinetic mechanisms for other cycloalkanes. Because cyclohexane produces only one type of cyclohexyl radical, much of the low-temperature chemistry of cyclohexane is described in terms of one potential energy diagram showing the reaction of cyclohexyl radical with O2 through five-, six-, and seven-membered-ring transition states. The direct elimination of cyclohexene and HO2 from RO2 is included in the treatment using a modified rate constant of Cavallotti et al. (Proc. Combust. Inst. 2007, 31, 201). Published and unpublished data from the Lille rapid compression machine, as well as jet-stirred reactor data, are used to validate the mechanism. The effect of heat loss is included in the simulations, an improvement on previous studies on cyclohexane. Calculations indicated that the production of 1,2-epoxycyclohexane observed in the experiments cannot be simulated according to the current understanding of low-temperature chemistry. Possible "alternative" H-atom isomerizations leading to different products from the parent O2QOOH radical were included in the low-temperature chemical kinetic mechanism and were found to play a significant role.},

abstract = {Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755, a butyric acid producing bacterium, has been engineered to overexpress aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (adhE2, Genebank no. AF321779) from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, which converts butyryl-CoA to butanol, under the control of native thiolase (thl) promoter. Butanol titer of 1.1g/L was obtained in C. tyrobutyricum overexpressing adhE2. The effects of inactivating acetate kinase (ack) and phosphotransbutyrylase (ptb) genes in the host on butanol production were then studied. A high C4/C2 product ratio of 10.6 (mol/mol) was obtained in ack knockout mutant, whereas a low C4/C2 product ratio of 1.4 (mol/mol) was obtained in ptb knockout mutant, confirming that ack and ptb genes play important roles in controlling metabolic flux distribution in C. tyrobutyricum. The highest butanol titer of 10.0g/L and butanol yield of 27.0\% (w/w, 66\% of theoretical yield) were achieved from glucose in the ack knockout mutant overexpressing adhE2. When a more reduced substrate mannitol was used, the butanol titer reached 16.0g/L with 30.6\% (w/w) yield (75\% theoretical yield). Moreover, C. tyrobutyricum showed good butanol tolerance, with >80\% and ∼60\% relative growth rate at 1.0\% and 1.5\% (v/v) butanol. These results suggest that C. tyrobutyricum is a promising heterologous host for n-butanol production from renewable biomass.},

abstract = {The thermal decomposition of 2-butanol have been studied at temperatures of 1045-1221 K and pressures of 1.5-6 bar using the single pulse shock tube technique. Dilute concentrations of 2-butanol have been decomposed in the presence of large quantities of a radical inhibitor. The mechanism for decomposition involves direct elimination of water producing cis- and trans-2-butene, and 1-butene, and C-C bond fission producing ethylene. Acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and propene were also observed in much smaller yields from C-C bond fission. The respective unimolecular rate expressions are as follows: k(C(3)H(6)(OH)CH(3) → cis-CH(3)CH═CHCH(3) + H(2)O) = 10(13.1 ± 0.3) exp(-33414 ± 755 K/T) s(-1); k(C(3)H(6)(OH)CH(3) → trans-CH(3)CH═CHCH(3) + H(2)O) = 10(13.5 ± 0.3) exp(-33820 ± 755 K/T) s(-1); k(C(3)H(6)(OH)CH(3) → CH(3)CH(2)CH═CH(2) + H(2)O) = 10(13.6 ± 0.3) exp(-33002 ± 755 K/T) s(-1); k(C(3)H(6)(OH)CH(3) → C(2)H(5)(•) + (•)CH(OH)CH(3)) = 10(15.9 ± 0.3) exp(-39252 ± 755 K/T) s(-1). These rate expressions are compared with analogous reactions for primary and tertiary butanols. They form a basis for the prediction of those for related systems. Comparison with estimated values used in the simulation of butanol combustion is indicative of the uncertainties in the rate constants that are used in such models. The activation energy of 326 kJ/mol leads to a bond dissociation energy of the CH(OH)CH(3) radical (H-CH(OH)CH(3)) of 400 kJ/mol, in excellent agreement with earlier calculated results from theory and disagreement with the experimental results from iodination studies in the expected range.},

abstract = {Although the combustion chemistry of aliphatic hydrocarbons has been extensively documented, the oxidation of cyclic hydrocarbons has been studied to a much lesser extent. To provide a deeper understanding of the combustion chemistry of naphthenes, the oxidation of methylcyclohexane was studied in a series of high-temperature shock tube experiments. Ignition delay times for a series of mixtures, of varying methylcyclohexane/oxygen equivalence ratios (phi=0.5, 1.0, 2.0), were measured over reflected shock temperatures of 1200-2100 K and reflected shock pressures of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 atm. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism has been assembled to simulate the shock tube results and flow reactor experiments, with good agreement observed.},

@article{Adler2011,
abstract = {A new explicitly correlated local coupled-cluster method with single and double excitations and a perturbative treatment of triple excitations [DF-LCCSD(T0)-F12x (x = a,b)] is presented. By means of truncating the virtual orbital space to pair-specific local domains (domain approximation) and a simplified treatment of close, weak and distant pairs using LMP2-F12 (pair approximation) the scaling of the computational cost with molecular size is strongly reduced. The basis set incompleteness errors as well as the errors due to the domain approximation are largely eliminated by the explicitly correlated terms. All integrals are computed using efficient density fitting (DF) approximations. The accuracy of the method is investigated for 52 reactions involving medium size molecules. A comparison of DF-LCCSD(T0)-F12x reaction energies with canonical CCSD(T)-F12x calculations shows that the errors introduced by the domain approximation are indeed very small. Care must be taken to keep the errors due to the additional pair approximation equally small, and appropriate distance criteria are recommended. Using these parameters, the root mean square (RMS) deviations of DF-LCCSD(T0)-F12a calculations with triple-$\zeta$ basis sets from estimated CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limits and experimental data amount to only 1.5 kJ mol(-1) and 2.9 kJ mol(-1), respectively. For comparison, the RMS deviation of the CCSD(T)/CBS values from the experimental values amounts to 3.0 kJ mol(-1). The potential of the method is demonstrated for five reactions of biochemical or pharmacological interest which include molecules with up to 61 atoms. These calculations show that molecules of this size can now be treated routinely and yield results that are close to the CCSD(T) complete basis set limits.},

@article{Jiang2009,
abstract = {A possible way to improve the economic efficacy of acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation is to increase the butanol ratio by eliminating the production of other by-products, such as acetone. The acetoacetate decarboxylase gene (adc) in the hyperbutanol-producing industrial strain Clostridium acetobutylicum EA 2018 was disrupted using TargeTron technology. The butanol ratio increased from 70\% to 80.05\%, with acetone production reduced to approximately 0.21 g/L in the adc-disrupted mutant (2018adc). pH control was a critical factor in the improvement of cell growth and solvent production in strain 2018adc. The regulation of electron flow by the addition of methyl viologen altered the carbon flux from acetic acid production to butanol production in strain 2018adc, which resulted in an increased butanol ratio of 82\% and a corresponding improvement in the overall yield of butanol from 57\% to 70.8\%. This study presents a general method of blocking acetone production by Clostridium and demonstrates the industrial potential of strain 2018adc.},

@article{Rosado-Reyes2013,
abstract = {Rate coefficients for the dehydration of isobutanol have been determined experimentally from comparative rate single pulse shock tube measurements and calculated via multi-structural transition state theory (MS-TST). They are represented by the Arrhenius expression, k(isobutanol → isobutene + H2O)experimental = 7.2×1013 exp(-35 300 K/T) s-1 The theoretical work leads to the high pressure rate expression, k(isobutanol → isobutene + H2O)theory = 3.5×1013 exp(-35 400 K/T) s-1 Results are thus within a factor of 2 of each other. The experimental results cover the temperature range of 1090 K-1240 K and pressure range of 1.5 to 6 atm, with no discernible pressure effects. Analysis of these results, in combination with earlier single pulse shock tube work, made possible to derive the governing factors that control the rate coefficients for alcohol dehydration in general. Alcohol dehydration rate contants depend on the location of the hydroxyl group (primary, secondary and tertiary) and the number of available H-atoms adjacent to the OH group for water elimination. The position of the H-atoms in the hydrocarbon backbone appears to be unimportant except for highly substituted molecules. From these correlations, we have derived, k(isopropanol → propene + H2O) = 7.2×1013 exp(-33 000 K/T) s-1 Comparison of experimental determination with theoretical calculations for this dehydration, and those for ethanol show deviations of the same magnitude as for isobutanol. Systematic differences between experiments and theoretical calculations are common.},

abstract = {This work reports measurements of absolute rate coefficients and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) master equation simulations of the C2H3+C2H4 reaction. Direct kinetic studies were performed over a temperature range of 300-700 K and pressures of 20 and 133 mbar. Vinyl radicals (H2C=CH) were generated by laser photolysis of vinyl iodide (C2H3I) at 266 nm, and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy was used to probe vinyl radicals through absorption at 423.2 nm. Measurements at 20 mbar are in good agreement with previous determinations at higher temperature. A weighted three-parameter Arrhenius fit to the experimental rate constant at 133 mbar, with the temperature exponent fixed, gives k=(7+/-1)x10(-14) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1) (T/298 K)2 exp[-(1430+/-70) K/T]. RRKM master equation simulations, based on G3 calculations of stationary points on the C4H7 potential energy surface, were carried out to predict rate coefficients and product branching fractions. The predicted branching to 1-methylallyl product is relatively small under the conditions of the present experiments but increases as the pressure is lowered. Analysis of end products of 248 nm photolysis of vinyl iodide/ethylene mixtures at total pressures between 27 and 933 mbar provides no direct evidence for participation of 1-methylallyl.},

abstract = {Reactions of hydroxyl (OH) radicals with 1-butene (k(1)), trans-2-butene (k(2)), and cis-2-butene (k(3)) were studied behind reflected shock waves over the temperature range 880-1341 K and at pressures near 2.2 atm. OH radicals were produced by shock-heating tert-butyl hydroperoxide, (CH(3))(3)-CO-OH, and monitored by narrow-line width ring dye laser absorption of the well-characterized R(1)(5) line of the OH A-X (0, 0) band near 306.7 nm. OH time histories were modeled using a comprehensive C(5) oxidation mechanism, and rate constants for the reaction of OH with butene isomers were extracted by matching modeled and measured OH concentration time histories. We present the first high-temperature measurement of OH + cis-2-butene and extend the temperature range of the only previous high-temperature study for both 1-butene and trans-2-butene. With the potential energy surface calculated using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p)//QCISD/6-31G(d), the rate constants and branching fractions for the H-abstraction channels of the reaction of OH with 1-butene were calculated in the temperature range 300-1500 K. Corrections for variational and tunneling effects as well as hindered-rotation treatments were included. The calculations are in good agreement with current and previous experimental data and with a recent theoretical study.},

abstract = {The cost-effective production of biofuels from renewable materials will begin to address energy security and climate change concerns. Ethanol, naturally produced by microorganisms, is currently the major biofuel in the transportation sector. However, its low energy content and incompatibility with existing fuel distribution and storage infrastructure limits its economic use in the future. Advanced biofuels, such as long chain alcohols and isoprenoid- and fatty acid-based biofuels, have physical properties that more closely resemble petroleum-derived fuels, and as such are an attractive alternative for the future supplementation or replacement of petroleum-derived fuels. Here, we review recent developments in the engineering of metabolic pathways for the production of known and potential advanced biofuels by microorganisms. We concentrate on the metabolic engineering of genetically tractable organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of these advanced biofuels.},

Manuscript flows among journals revealed a modular submission network, with high-impact journals preferentially attracting submissions. However, about 75\% of published articles were submitted first to the journal that would publish them, and high-impact journals published proportionally more articles that had been resubmitted from another journal. Submission history affected postpublication impact: Resubmissions from other journals received significantly more citations than first-intent submissions, and resubmissions between different journal communities received significantly fewer citations.},

abstract = {Planetary formation theories suggest that the giant planets formed on circular and coplanar orbits. The eccentricities of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, however, reach values of 6 per cent, 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of approximately 2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals. Our model reproduces all the important characteristics of the giant planets' orbits, namely their final semimajor axes, eccentricities and mutual inclinations.},

abstract = {Unimolecular dissociation of a neopentyl radical to isobutene and methyl radical is competitive with the neopentyl association with O2 ((3)Sigma(g)-) in thermal oxidative systems. Furthermore, both isobutene and the OH radical are important primary products from the reactions of neopentyl with O2. Consequently, the reactions of O2 with the 2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl radicals resulting from the OH addition to isobutene are important to understanding the oxidation of neopentane and other branched hydrocarbons. Reactions that correspond to the association of radical adducts with O2((3)Sigma(g)-) involve chemically activated peroxy intermediates, which can isomerize and react to form one of several products before stabilization. The above reaction systems were analyzed with ab initio and density functional calculations to evaluate the thermochemistry, reaction paths, and kinetics that are important in neopentyl radical oxidation. The stationary points of potential energy surfaces were analyzed based on the enthalpies calculated at the CBS-Q level. The entropies, S(degrees)298, and heat capacities, C(p)(T), (0 <or= T/K <or= 1500), from vibration, translation, and external rotation contributions were calculated using statistical mechanics based on the vibrational frequencies and structures obtained from the density functional study. The hindered internal rotor contributions to S(degrees)298 and C(p)(T) were calculated by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with free rotor wave functions, and the partition coefficients were treated by direct integration over energy levels of the internal rotation potentials. Enthalpies of formation (DeltaH(f)(degrees)298) were determined using isodesmic reaction analysis. The DeltaH(f)(degrees)298 values of (CH3)2C*CH(2)OH, (CH3)2C(OO*)CH(2)OH, (CH3)2C(OH)C*H2, and (CH3)2C(OH)CH(2)OO* radicals were determined to be -23.3, -62.2, -24.2, and -61.8 kcal mol(-1), respectively. Elementary rate constants were calculated from canonical transition state theory, and pressure-dependent rate constants for multichannel reaction systems were calculated as functions of pressure and temperature using multifrequency quantum Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel (QRRK) analysis for k(E) and a master equation for pressure falloff. Kinetic parameters for intermediate and product formation channels of the above reaction systems are presented as functions of temperature and pressure.},

abstract = {Computational singular perturbation (CSP) analysis has been used to gain understanding of the complex kinetic behavior associated with two-stage ignition of large hydrocarbon molecules. To this end, available detailed and reduced chemical kinetics models commonly used in numerical simulations of n-heptane oxidation phenomena are directly analyzed to interpret the underlying fundamental steps leading to two-stage ignition. Unlike previous implementations of the CSP methodology, temperature is included as one of the state variables so that factors controlling ignition can be unambiguously determined. The analyzed models show differences in the factors contributing to the initial development and shutdown of the first ignition stage. However, during the second stage, both models show the importance of the degenerate branching decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which contradicts some previous interpretations of this phenomenon.},

@article{Jasper2009,
abstract = {Direct classical trajectories are used to compute energy transfer parameters appropriate for use in master equation calculations for the CH4 <--> CH3 + H reaction in He at 300-2000 K. The quantum chemistry method used in the direct trajectory calculations is MP2/aug'-cc-pVDZ, which is validated against higher level ab initio calculations. The average energy transferred in deactivating collisions is shown to increase with the initial rotational excitation J' of CH4 and with the temperature of the bath gas T(bath). When thermally averaged over J', the resulting average downward energy transfer alpha is found to increase nearly linearly with T(bath) (alpha = 110T(bath)0.81 cm(-1)). The results of master equation calculations carried out using the single-exponential-down model and the computed values of alpha are compared with experimental results and recent recommendations. At elevated temperatures (>600 K), good agreement between the predicted and experimental rate coefficients is obtained. At room temperature, the computed rate coefficients are in good agreement with the experimental results if the two-dimensional (E, J) formulation of the master equation is used. Smaller values of alpha (by 25\%) are necessary to fit the experimental data at room temperature using the one-dimensional (E) master equation. The present study, combined with previous ab initio transition state theory calculations for the CH3 + H capture rate, provides a complete first-principles characterization of the temperature and pressure dependent rate coefficients for this simple single-well system.},

@article{Dixon2006,
abstract = {The heats of formation of saturated and unsaturated diaminocarbenes (imadazol(in)-2-ylidenes) have been calculated by using high levels of ab initio electronic structure theory. The calculations were done at the coupled cluster level through noniterative triple excitations with augmented correlation consistent basis sets up through quadruple. In addition, four other corrections were applied to the frozen core atomization energies: (1) a zero point vibrational correction; (2) a core/valence correlation correction; (3) a scalar relativistic correction; (4) a first-order atomic spin-orbit correction. The value of DeltaHf( 298) for the unsaturated carbene 1 is calculated to be 56.4 kcal/mol. The value of DeltaHf( 298) for the unsaturated triplet carbene (3)1 is calculated to be 142.8 kcal/mol, giving a singlet-triplet splitting of 86.4 kcal/mol. Addition of a proton to 1 forms 3 with DeltaHf( 298)(3) = 171.6 kcal/mol with a proton affinity for 1 of 250.5 kcal/mol at 298 K. Addition of a hydrogen atom to 1 forms 4 with DeltaHf( 298)(4) = 72.7 kcal/mol and a C-H bond energy of 35.8 kcal/mol at 298 K. Addition of H- to 1 gives 5 with DeltaHf( 298)(5) = 81.2 kcal/mol and 5 is not stable with respect to loss of an electron to form 4. Addition of H2 to the carbene center forms 6 with DeltaHf( 298)(6) = 41.5 kcal/mol and a heat of hydrogenation at 298 K of -14.9 kcal/mol. The value of DeltaHf( 298) for the saturated carbene 7 (obtained by adding H2 to the C=C bond of 1) is 47.4 kcal/mol. Hydrogenation of 7 to form the fully saturated imidazolidine, 8, gives DeltaHf( 298)(8) = 14.8 kcal/mol and a heat of hydrogenation at 298 K of -32.6 kcal/mol. The estimated error bars for the calculated heats of formation are +/-1.0 kcal/mol.},

@article{Ionescu2004,
abstract = {Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is becoming increasingly widespread in many fields of engineering and sciences, encompassing practically all of the experimental data-processing activities and many computational modeling and process simulation activities. There are many methods, based either on deterministic or statistical concepts, for performing sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. However, a precise, unified terminology across all methods does not seem to exist, yet often, identical words (e.g., 'sensitivity') may not necessarily describe identical quantities, particularly when stemming from conceptually distinct (statistical versus deterministic) methods. Furthermore, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various methods do not seem to have been reviewed comparatively in the literature published thus far.This paper is the first part of a comparative review, written in two parts, that focuses on the salient features of the statistical and deterministic methods currently used for local and global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of both large-scale computational models and indirect experimental measurements. Deterministic methods are analyzed in Part I, while statistical methods are highlighted in Part II.Part I of this review commences by highlighting the deterministic methods for computing local sensitivities, namely, the so-called Brute-Force Method (based on recalculations), the Direct Method (including the Decoupled Direct Method), the Green's Function Method, the Forward Sensitivity Analysis Procedure (FSAP), and the Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis Procedure (ASAP). Except for the Brute-Force Method, it is emphasized that local sensitivities can be computed exactly and exhaustively only by using deterministic methods. Furthermore, it is noted that the Direct Method and the FSAP require at least as many model evaluations as there are parameters, while the ASAP requires a single model evaluation of an appropriate adjoint model whose source term is related to the response under investigation. If this adjoint model is developed simultaneously with the original model, then the adjoint model requires relatively modest additional resources to develop and implement. If, however, the adjoint model is constructed a posteriori, considerable skills may be required for its successful development and implementation. Nevertheless, the ASAP is the most efficient method to use for computing local sensitivities of large-scale systems, where the number of parameters, and parameter variations, exceeds the number of responses of interest.The Global ASAP (GASAP) is also highlighted as it appears to be the only deterministic method published thus far for performing genuinely global analysis of nonlinear systems. The GASAP uses both the forward and the adjoint sensitivity systems to explore, exhaustively and efficiently, the entire phase-space of system parameters and dependent variables in order to obtain complete information about the important global features of the physical system, namely, the critical points of the response and the bifurcation branches and/or turning points of the system's state variables.},

@article{Schuurman2004,
abstract = {In continuing pursuit of thermochemical accuracy to the level of 0.1 kcal mol(-1), the heats of formation of NCO, HNCO, HOCN, HCNO, and HONC have been rigorously determined using state-of-the-art ab initio electronic structure theory, including conventional coupled cluster methods [coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD), CCSD with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), and full coupled cluster through triple excitations (CCSDT)] with large basis sets, conjoined in cases with explicitly correlated MP2-R12/A computations. Limits of valence and all-electron correlation energies were extrapolated via focal point analysis using correlation consistent basis sets of the form cc-pVXZ (X=2-6) and cc-pCVXZ (X=2-5), respectively. In order to reach subchemical accuracy targets, core correlation, spin-orbit coupling, special relativity, the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction, and anharmonicity in zero-point vibrational energies were accounted for. Various coupled cluster schemes for partially including connected quadruple excitations were also explored, although none of these approaches gave reliable improvements over CCSDT theory. Based on numerous, independent thermochemical paths, each designed to balance residual ab initio errors, our final proposals are DeltaH(f,0) ( composite function )(NCO)=+30.5, DeltaH(f,0) ( composite function )(HNCO)=-27.6, DeltaH(f,0) ( composite function )(HOCN)=-3.1, DeltaH(f,0) ( composite function )(HCNO)=+40.9, and DeltaH(f,0) ( composite function )(HONC)=+56.3 kcal mol(-1). The internal consistency and convergence behavior of the data suggests accuracies of +/-0.2 kcal mol(-1) in these predictions, except perhaps in the HCNO case. However, the possibility of somewhat larger systematic errors cannot be excluded, and the need for CCSDTQ [full coupled cluster through quadruple excitations] computations to eliminate remaining uncertainties is apparent.},

@article{Black2010a,
abstract = {The barrier heights involved in the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from n-butanol by the hydroperoxyl radical have been computed with both compound (CBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, G3) and coupled cluster methods. In particular, the benchmark computations CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-311G(d,p) were used to determine that the barrier heights increase in the order alpha < gamma < beta < delta < OH. Two prereaction hydrogen-bonded complexes are formed, one of which connects the TGt conformer of n-butanol to the alpha and beta transition states and the other connects to the gamma and OH channels from the TGg conformer. Four postreaction complexes were also found which link the transition states to the products, hydrogen peroxide + C(4)H(9)O radical. Abstraction from the terminal delta carbon atom does not involve either a pre or postreaction complex. A number of DFT functionals-B3LYP, BMK, MPWB1K, BB1K, MPW1K, and M05-2X-were tested to see whether the correct ranking could be obtained with computationally less expensive methods. Only the later functional predicts the correct order but requires a basis set of 6-311++G(df,pd) to achieve this. However, the absolute values obtained do not agree that well with the benchmarks; the composite G3 method predicts the correct order and comes closest (< or = 2 kJ, mol (-1)) in absolute numerical terms for H-abstraction from carbon.},

abstract = {A method for measuring the temporal temperature and number density in a rapid compression machine (RCM) using quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy near 7.6 $\mu$m is developed and presented in this paper. The ratios of H2O absorption peaks at 1316.55 cm-1 and 1316.97 cm-1 are used for these measurements. In order to isolate the effects of chemical reactions, an inert mixture of argon with 2.87\% water vapor is used for the present investigation. The end of compression pressures and temperatures in the RCM measurements are PC=10, 15, and 20 bar in the range of TC=1000 to 1200 K. The measured temperature history is compared with that calculated based on the adiabatic core assumption and is found to be within ±5 K. The measured temporal number density of H2O to an accuracy of 1\%, using the absolute absorption of the two rovibrational lines, show that the mixture is highly uniform in temperature. A six-pass, 5.08 cm Herriott cell is used to calibrate the line strengths in air and broadening in an Ar bath gas.},

@article{Laden2006,
abstract = {RATIONALE: A large body of epidemiologic literature has found an association of increased fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) with acute and chronic mortality. The effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear. OBJECTIVES: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution concentrations. METHODS: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for individual risk factors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found an increase in overall mortality associated with each 10 microg/m3 increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (RR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (RR, 1.27; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased mean PM2.5 (10 microg/m3) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.57-0.95). CONCLUSION: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Reduced PM2.5 concentrations were associated with reduced mortality risk.},

@article{Zheng2011,
abstract = {Many methods for correcting harmonic partition functions for the presence of torsional motions employ some form of one-dimensional torsional treatment to replace the harmonic contribution of a specific normal mode. However, torsions are often strongly coupled to other degrees of freedom, especially other torsions and low-frequency bending motions, and this coupling can make assigning torsions to specific normal modes problematic. Here, we present a new class of methods, called multi-structural (MS) methods, that circumvents the need for such assignments by instead adjusting the harmonic results by torsional correction factors that are determined using internal coordinates. We present three versions of the MS method: (i) MS-AS based on including all structures (AS), i.e., all conformers generated by internal rotations; (ii) MS-ASCB based on all structures augmented with explicit conformational barrier (CB) information, i.e., including explicit calculations of all barrier heights for internal-rotation barriers between the conformers; and (iii) MS-RS based on including all conformers generated from a reference structure (RS) by independent torsions. In the MS-AS scheme, one has two options for obtaining the local periodicity parameters, one based on consideration of the nearly separable limit and one based on strongly coupled torsions. The latter involves assigning the local periodicities on the basis of Voronoi volumes. The methods are illustrated with calculations for ethanol, 1-butanol, and 1-pentyl radical as well as two one-dimensional torsional potentials. The MS-AS method is particularly interesting because it does not require any information about conformational barriers or about the paths that connect the various structures.},

@article{Groom2008,
abstract = {Biofuels are a new priority in efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; nevertheless, the rapid increase in production of biofuel feedstock may threaten biodiversity. There are general principles that should be used in developing guidelines for certifying biodiversity-friendly biofuels. First, biofuel feedstocks should be grown with environmentally safe and biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices. The sustainability of any biofuel feedstock depends on good growing practices and sound environmental practices throughout the fuel-production life cycle. Second, the ecological footprint of a biofuel, in terms of the land area needed to grow sufficient quantities of the feedstock, should be minimized. The best alternatives appear to be fuels of the future, especially fuels derived from microalgae. Third, biofuels that can sequester carbon or that have a negative or zero carbon balance when viewed over the entire production life cycle should be given high priority. Corn-based ethanol is the worst among the alternatives that are available at present, although this is the biofuel that is most advanced for commercial production in the United States. We urge aggressive pursuit of alternatives to corn as a biofuel feedstock. Conservation biologists can significantly broaden and deepen efforts to develop sustainable fuels by playing active roles in pursuing research on biodiversity-friendly biofuel production practices and by helping define biodiversity-friendly biofuel certification standards.},

The butanol mechanism includes 1446 reactions, and we demonstrate that it is straightforward and computationally feasible to implement a full global sensitivity analysis incorporating all the reactions. In addition, we extend our previous analysis of ignition-delay targets to include species targets. The combination of species and ignition targets leads to multitarget global sensitivity analysis, which allows for a more complete mechanism validation procedure than we previously implemented. The inclusion of species sensitivity analysis allows for a direct comparison between reaction pathway analysis and global sensitivity analysis.},

Recent observations from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft show that the relative motion of the Sun with respect to the interstellar medium is slower and in a somewhat different direction than previously thought. Here, we provide combined consensus values for this velocity vector and show that they have important implications for the global interstellar interaction. In particular, the velocity is almost certainly slower than the fast magnetosonic speed, with no bow shock forming ahead of the heliosphere, as was widely expected in the past.},

Recognizing their apparent disadvantages, scientists and engineers are developing more sustainable and economically feasible second generation biofuels. The new microbial fuels summarized here have great potential to become viable replacements or at least supplements of petroleum-derived liquid transportation fuels. Yields and efficiencies of the four metabolic pathways leading to these microbial fuels-mostly designed and optimized in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using modern tools of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology-and the robustness of the biocatalysts that convert the metabolic intermediates to, in some cases, finished and engine-ready fuels, will determine if they can be commercially successful and contribute to alleviating our dependence on fossil fuels.},

@article{Zheng2009,
abstract = {With the incessant fluctuations in oil prices and increasing stress from environmental pollution, renewed attention is being paid to the microbial production of biofuels from renewable sources. As a gasoline substitute, butanol has advantages over traditional fuel ethanol in terms of energy density and hygroscopicity. A variety of cheap substrates have been successfully applied in the production of biobutanol, highlighting the commercial potential of biobutanol development. In this review, in order to better understand the process of acetone-butanol-ethanol production, traditional clostridia fermentation is discussed. Sporulation is probably induced by solvent formation, and the molecular mechanism leading to the initiation of sporulation and solventogenesis is also investigated. Different strategies are employed in the metabolic engineering of clostridia that aim to enhancing solvent production, improve selectivity for butanol production, and increase the tolerance of clostridia to solvents. However, it will be hard to make breakthroughs in the metabolic engineering of clostridia for butanol production without gaining a deeper understanding of the genetic background of clostridia and developing more efficient genetic tools for clostridia. Therefore, increasing attention has been paid to the metabolic engineering of E. coli for butanol production. The importation and expression of a non-clostridial butanol-producing pathway in E. coli is probably the most promising strategy for butanol biosynthesis. Due to the lower butanol titers in the fermentation broth, simultaneous fermentation and product removal techniques have been developed to reduce the cost of butanol recovery. Gas stripping is the best technique for butanol recovery found so far.},

A comparison of RPMD with previous theoretical results obtained using transition state theory shows that RPMD is a more reliable theoretical approach for systems with more than 6 atoms, which provides a predictable level of accuracy. We show that the success of RPMD is a direct result of its independence of the choice of transition state dividing surface, a feature that is not shared by any of the transition state theory-based methods. Our results demonstrate that RPMD is a prospective method for studies of KIEs for polyatomic reactions for which rigorous quantum mechanical calculations are currently impossible.},

Prior impact simulations predict that much of the disk material originates from the impacting planet. However, the Earth and Moon have essentially identical oxygen isotope compositions. This has been a challenge for the impact theory, because the impactor's composition would have likely differed from that of the Earth. Here, we simulate impacts involving larger impactors than previously considered. We show that these can produce a disk with the same composition as the planet's mantle, consistent with Earth-Moon compositional similarities. Such impacts require subsequent removal of angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system through a resonance with the Sun, as recently proposed.},

abstract = {The rate coefficients of H-abstraction reactions of butene isomers by the OH radical were determined by both canonical variational transition-state theory and transition-state theory, with potential energy surfaces calculated at the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p)//BH\&HLYP/6-311G(d,p) level and CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p)//BH\&HLYP/cc-pVTZ level and quantum mechanical tunneling effect corrected by either the small-curvature tunneling method or the Eckart method. While 1-butene contains allylic, vinylic, and alkyl hydrogens that can be abstracted to form different butene radicals, results reveal that s-allylic H-abstraction channels have low and broad energy barriers, and they are the most dominant channels which can occur via direct and indirect H-abstraction channels. For the indirect H-abstraction s-allylic channel, the reaction can proceed via forming two van der Waals prereactive complexes with energies that are 2.7-2.8 kcal mol(-1) lower than that of the entrance channel at 0 K. Assuming that neither mixing nor crossover occurs between different reaction pathways, the overall rate coefficient was calculated by summing the rate coefficients of the s-allyic, methyl, and vinyl H-abstraction paths and found to agree well with the experimentally measured OH disappearance rate. Furthermore, the rate coefficients of p-allylic H abstraction of cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, and isobutene by the OH radical were also determined at 300-1500 K, with results analyzed and compared with available experimental data.},

abstract = {In the present work, we study the H atom abstraction reactions by hydroxyl radical at all five sites of 1-butanol. Multistructural variational transition state theory (MS-VTST) was employed to estimate the five thermal rate constants. MS-VTST utilizes a multifaceted dividing surface that accounts for the multiple conformational structures of the transition state, and we also include all the structures of the reactant molecule. The vibrational frequencies and minimum energy paths (MEPs) were computed using the M08-HX/MG3S electronic structure method. The required potential energy surfaces were obtained implicitly by direct dynamics employing interpolated variational transition state theory with mapping (IVTST-M) using a variational reaction path algorithm. The M08-HX/MG3S electronic model chemistry was then used to calculate multistructural torsional anharmonicity factors to complete the MS-VTST rate constant calculations. The results indicate that torsional anharmonicity is very important at higher temperatures, and neglecting it would lead to errors of 26 and 32 at 1000 and 1500 K, respectively. Our results for the sums of the site-specific rate constants agree very well with the experimental values of Hanson and co-workers at 896-1269 K and with the experimental results of Campbell et al. at 292 K, but slightly less well with the experiments of Wallington et al., Nelson et al., and Yujing and Mellouki at 253-372 K; nevertheless, the calculated rates are within a factor of 1.61 of all experimental values at all temperatures. This gives us confidence in the site-specific values, which are currently inaccessible to experiment.},

abstract = {The complete basis set method CBS-QB3 has been used to study the thermochemistry and kinetics of the esters ethyl propanoate (EP) and methyl butanoate (MB) to evaluate initiation reactions and intermediate products from unimolecular decomposition reactions. Using isodesmic and isogeitonic equations and atomization energies, we have estimated chemically accurate enthalpies of formation and bond dissociation energies for the esters and species derived from them. In addition it is shown that controversial literature values may be resolved by adopting, for the acetate radical, CH3C(O)O(.-), DeltaH(o)(f)298.15K) = -197.8 kJ mol(-1) and for the trans-hydrocarboxyl radical, C(.-)(O)OH, -181.6 +/- 2.9 kJ mol(-1). For EP, the lowest energy decomposition path encounters an energy barrier of approximately 210 kJ mol(-1) (approximately 50 kcal mol(-1)), which proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state (retro-ene reaction) via transfer of the primary methyl H atom from the ethyl group to the carbonyl oxygen, while cleaving the carbon-ether oxygen to form ethene and propanoic acid. On the other hand, the lowest energy path for MB has a barrier of approximately 285 kJ mol(-1), producing ethene. Other routes leading to the formation of aldehydes, alcohols, ketene, and propene are also discussed. Most of these intramolecular hydrogen transfers have energy barriers lower than that needed for homolytic bond fission (the lowest of which is 353 kJ mol(-1) for the C(alpha)-C(beta) bond in MB). Propene formation is a much higher energy demanding process, 402 kJ mol(-1), and it should be competitive with some C-C, C-O, and C-H bond cleavage processes.},

@article{Byrd2006,
abstract = {We present simple atom and group-equivalent methods that will convert quantum mechanical energies of molecules to gas phase heats of formation of CHNO systems. In addition, we predict heats of sublimation and vaporization derived from information obtained from the quantum-mechanically calculated electrostatic potential of each isolated molecule. The heats of sublimation and vaporization are combined with the aforementioned gas phase heats of formation to produce completely predicted condensed phase heats of formation. These semiempirical computational methods, calibrated using experimental information, were applied to a series of CHNO molecules for which no experimental information was used in the development of the methods. These methods improve upon an earlier effort of Rice et al. [Rice, B. M.; Pai, S. V.; Hare, J. Combust. Flame 1999, 118, 445] through the use of a larger basis set and the application of group equivalents. The root-mean-square deviation (rms) from experiment for the predicted group-equivalent gas phase heats of formation is 3.2 kcal/mol with a maximum deviation of 6.5 kcal/mol. The rms and maximum deviation of the predicted liquid heats of formation are 3.2 and 7.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Finally, the rms and maximum deviation of predicted solid heats of formation are 5.6 and 12.2 kcal/mol, respectively, an improvement in the rms of approximately 40\% compared to the earlier Rice et al. predictions using atom equivalents and a smaller basis set (B3LYP/6-31G*).},

@article{Simmie2009,
abstract = {Although enols have been identified in alcohol and other flames and in interstellar space and have been implicated in the formation of carboxylic acids in the urban troposphere in the past few years, the reactions that give rise to them are virtually unknown. To address this data deficit, particularly with regard to biobutanol combustion, we have carried out a number of ab initio calculations with the multilevel methods CBS-QB3 and CBS-APNO to determine the activation enthalpies for methyl addition to the CH(2) group of CH(2)=CHX where X = H, OH, and CH(3). These average at 26.3 +/- 1.0 kJ mol(-1) and are not influenced by the nature of X; addition to the CHX end is energetically costlier and does show the influence of group X = OH and CH(3). Replacing the attacking methyl radical by ethyl makes very little difference to addition at CH(2) and follows the same trend of a higher barrier for addition to the CH(OH) end. In the case of H-addition it is more problematic to draw general conclusions since the DFT-based methodology, CBS-QB3, struggles to locate transition states for some reactions. However, the increase in barrier heights in reaction at the CHX end in comparison to addition at the methylene end is evident. For hydrogen atom reaction with the carbonyl group in the compounds methanal, ethanal, propanal, and butanal we see that for addition at the O-center the barrier heights of ca. 38 kJ mol(-1) are not influenced by the nature of the alkyl group whereas addition at the C-center is different on going from H --> alkyl but seems to be invariant at 20 kJ mol(-1) once alkylated. Rate constants for H-atom elimination from 1-hydroxyethyl, 1-hydroxypropyl, and 1-hydroxybutyl radicals, valid over the range 800-2000 K, are reported. These demonstrate that enols are more prevalent than previously suspected and that 1-buten-1-ol should be almost as abundant as its isomeric aldehyde 1-butanal during the combustion of 1-butanol and that this will also be the case for other alcohols provided that the appropriate structural features are present. Since the toxicity of enols is not known experiments and further theoretical studies are clearly desirable before the large-scale usage of alcohol biofuels commences. An enthalpy of formation for butanal of Delta(f)H(298.15 K) = -204.4 +/- 1.4 kJ mol(-1) [Buckley, E.; Cox, J. D. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1967, 63 , 895 901] is recommended, the uncertainty surrounding that for the 2-hydroxypropyl radical has been markedly reduced, and new values for 1-buten-1-ol, 1-propen-1-ol, and 2-propen-2-ol of -171.8 +/- 1.6, -151.8 +/- 1.7, and -169.9 +/- 1.5 kJ mol(-1), respectively, are proposed.},

abstract = {Quantum chemistry has become one of the most reliable tools for characterizing the thermochemical underpinnings of reactions, such as bond dissociation energies (BDEs). The accurate prediction of these particular properties (BDEs) are challenging for ab initio methods based on perturbative corrections or coupled cluster expansions of the single-determinant Hartree-Fock wave function: the processes of bond breaking and forming are inherently multi-configurational and require an accurate description of non-dynamical electron correlation. To this end, we present a systematic ab initio approach for computing BDEs that is based on three components: 1) multi-reference single and double excitation configuration interaction (MRSDCI) for the electronic energies; 2) a two-parameter scheme for extrapolating MRSDCI energies to the complete basis set limit; and 3) DFT-B3LYP calculations of minimum-energy structures and vibrational frequencies to account for zero point energy and thermal corrections. We validated our methodology against a set of reliable experimental BDE values of CC and CH bonds of hydrocarbons. The goal of chemical accuracy is achieved, on average, without applying any empirical corrections to the MRSDCI electronic energies. We then use this composite scheme to make predictions of BDEs in a large number of hydrocarbon molecules for which there are no experimental data, so as to provide needed thermochemical estimates for fuel molecules.},

abstract = {A linear regression correction approach has been developed successfully to account for the electron correlation energy missing in Hartree-Fock calculation and to reduce the calculation errors of density functional theory. The numbers of lone-pair electrons, bonding electrons and inner layer electrons in molecules, and the number of unpaired electrons in the composing atoms in their ground states are chosen to be the most important physical descriptors to determine the correlation energy unaccounted by Hartree-Fock method or to improve the results calculated by B3LYP density functional theory method. As a demonstration, this proposed linear regression correction approach has been applied to evaluate the standard heats of formation DeltaH(f) (Theta) of 180 small-sized to medium-sized organic molecules at 298.15 K. Upon correction, the mean absolute deviation for the 150 molecules in the training set decreases from 351.0 to 4.6 kcal/mol and 360.9 to 4.6 kcal/mol for HF/6-31G(d) and HF/6-311+G(d,p) methods, respectively. For B3LYP method, the mean absolute deviations are reduced from 9.2 and 18.2 kcal/mol to 2.7 and 2.4 kcal/mol for 6-31G(d) and 6-311+G(d,p) basis sets, respectively.},

abstract = {As mobility is a major pillar of World's economic system and burning fuels from fossil resources leads to a dramatic increase in greenhouse gas emissions, the production and use of appropriate biofuels offer at least a partial solution to this problem. Butanol represents a biofuel extender or replacement with properties clearly superior to ethanol (higher mileage, not hygroscopic, usable without engine modifications, not corrosive). In addition, it is a valuable feedstock for the chemical industry. Scientific challenges for an economically competitive fermentation process include employment of cheap carbon sources, not competing with nutrition, a detailed understanding of the metabolic reactions of the biological process, development of appropriately engineered construction strains, and adaption of process technology to modern standards.},

Recently, progress has been made in the development of microbe-based processes for the production of biofuels beyond ethanol. These biofuels possess superior fuel properties relative to ethanol, such as increased energy density, low hygroscopicity, and low vapor pressure. These fuels are also advantageous as they may be transported using existing infrastructure. The isobutanol production process, in particular, has already reached near-industrial level. Although many of these processes are still being scaled-up for commercial production, their potential for practical application is promising.},

abstract = {The earliest history of the Moon is poorly preserved in the surface geologic record because of the high flux of impactors, but aspects of that history may be preserved in subsurface structures. Application of gravity gradiometry to observations by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission results in the identification of a population of linear gravity anomalies with lengths of hundreds of kilometers. Inversion of the gravity anomalies indicates elongated positive density anomalies interpreted to be ancient vertical tabular intrusions or dikes, formed by magmatism in combination with extension of the lithosphere. Crosscutting relationships support a pre-Nectarian to Nectarian age, preceding the end of the heavy bombardment of the Moon. The distribution, orientation, and dimensions of the intrusions indicate a globally isotropic extensional stress state arising from an increase in the Moon's radius by 0.6 to 4.9 km early in lunar history, consistent with predictions of thermal models.},

abstract = {We calculated the forward and reverse rate constants of the hydrogen abstraction reaction from carbon-2 of 2-methyl-1-propanol by hydroperoxyl radical over the temperature range 250-2400 K by using multistructural canonical variational transition state theory (MS-CVT) including both multiple-structure and torsional potential anharmonicity effects by the multistructural torsional anharmonicity (MS-T) method. In these calculations, multidimensional tunneling (MT) probabilities used to compute the tunneling transmission coefficients were evaluated by the small-curvature tunneling (SCT) approximation. Comparison with the rate constants obtained by the single-structural harmonic oscillator (SS-HO) approximation shows that multistructural anharmonicity increases the forward rate constants for all temperatures, but the reverse rate constants are reduced for temperatures lower than 430 K and increased for higher temperatures. The neglect of multistructural torsional anharmonicity would lead to errors of factors of 1.5, 8.8, and 13 at 300, 1000, and 2400 K, respectively, for the forward reaction, and would lead to errors of factors of 0.76, 3.0, and 6.0, respectively, at these temperatures for the reverse reaction.},

@article{Schwartz2006,
abstract = {Biomass fuels are a promising renewable energy source, and so, the mechanisms that may produce toxic oxygenated byproducts and aromatic hydrocarbons from oxygenated hydrocarbons are of interest. Esters have the form R-(C=O)-O-R' and are components of biodiesel fuels. The five specific esters studied here are isomers of C5H10O2. The experiments were performed in atmospheric pressure coflowing methane/air non-premixed flames. A series of flames were generated by separately doping the fuel mixture with 5,000 ppm of each ester. This concentration is sufficiently large to produce measurable changes in intermediate hydrocarbon concentrations, yet small enough to not disturb the overall flame structure. Since the overall structure is not perturbed, the measured changes in the intermediate hydrocarbons can be directly attributed to the reactions of the esters. Analysis of these changes reveals that unimolecular six-centered dissociation is the primary decomposition pathway for the three esters with molecular arrangements capable of undergoing that mechanism. The remaining two esters exhibited decomposition rates and products that are consistent with simple fission as the dominant decomposition mechanism, though we do not exclude other pathways from playing a significant role in their decomposition. All of the esters produce aromatic hydrocarbons at higher rates than the undoped fuel, and the molecular arrangement of the ester isomers plays a role in the degree of aromatic formation. Isomer variations also influence the type and quantity of toxic oxygenates that are produced in the flames.},

It uses the HDMR (high-dimensional model representation) expansion and the features of the sensitivity indices to explore the probability density function (pdf) of predicted target outputs that results from the uncertainties in the rate coefficients. We study the autoignition of H(2)/O(2) mixtures, where the pdf describes the uncertainty in ignition delay times due to the uncertainties in the rate coefficients. The global sensitivity analysis in conjunction with the HDMR expansion allows for the deconstruction of the pdf in several different ways. These deconstructions allow the features of the pdf to be understood in terms of the constitute reactions in much finer detail than the study of a variance decomposition alone.},

The instrument utilizes a side-sampled flow tube reactor, continuously tunable synchrotron radiation for photoionization, a multimass double-focusing mass spectrometer with 100\% duty cycle, and a time- and position-sensitive detector for single ion counting. This approach enables multiplexed, universal detection of molecules with high sensitivity and selectivity. In addition to measurement of rate coefficients as a function of temperature and pressure, different structural isomers can be distinguished based on their photoionization efficiency curves, providing a more detailed probe of reaction mechanisms. The multiplexed three-dimensional data structure (intensity as a function of molecular mass, reaction time, and photoionization energy) provides insights that might not be available in serial acquisition, as well as additional constraints on data interpretation.},

abstract = {Bimolecular reactions in Earth's atmosphere are generally assumed to proceed between reactants whose internal quantum states are fully thermally relaxed. Here, we highlight a dramatic role for vibrationally excited bimolecular reactants in the oxidation of acetylene. The reaction proceeds by preliminary adduct formation between the alkyne and OH radical, with subsequent O(2) addition. Using a detailed theoretical model, we show that the product-branching ratio is determined by the excited vibrational quantum-state distribution of the adduct at the moment it reacts with O(2). Experimentally, we found that under the simulated atmospheric conditions O(2) intercepts \~{}25\% of the excited adducts before their vibrational quantum states have fully relaxed. Analogous interception of excited-state radicals by O(2) is likely common to a range of atmospheric reactions that proceed through peroxy complexes.},

abstract = {Sooting tendencies have been measured for 186 oxygenated and 89 regular hydrocarbons under controlled laboratory conditions. The test compounds include alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alkanes, alkenes, and cycloalkanes ranging in size from methanol to isododecane. Sooting tendency was characterized with a new method based on measuring particle concentrations in methane/air nonpremixed flames when 1000 ppm of each test compound was added to the fuel. This method offers high precision and high sensitivity to the direct chemical effects of the additive. The results provide a wide-ranging yet detailed quantitative picture of how fuel oxygen affects soot formation, which will be useful for optimizing the soot-reducing benefits of oxygenated renewable fuels. The measured sooting tendencies of 1-alcohols are similar to those of n-alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms, while those of secondary alcohols are slightly higher. Aldehydes and ketones soot the same as n-alkanes with one less carbon atom. The sooting tendencies of esters depend strongly on molecular structure and increase in this order: methyl and ethyl esters < carboxylic acids, propyl esters, and n-alkanes < butyl and pentyl esters. The high sooting tendencies of the secondary alcohols and higher esters suggest that four-center and six-center reaction pathways are important.},

abstract = {Models for chemical mechanisms of hydrocarbon oxidation rely on spectrometric identification of molecular structures in flames. Carbonyl (keto) compounds are well-established combustion intermediates. However, their less-stable enol tautomers, bearing OH groups adjacent to carbon-carbon double bonds, are not included in standard models. We observed substantial quantities of two-, three-, and four-carbon enols by photoionization mass spectrometry of flames burning representative compounds from modern fuel blends. Concentration profiles demonstrate that enol flame chemistry cannot be accounted for purely by keto-enol tautomerization. Currently accepted hydrocarbon oxidation mechanisms will likely require revision to explain the formation and reactivity of these unexpected compounds.},

Unimolecular pressure- and temperature-dependent rate coefficients were calculated over broad ranges of temperature (300-2500 K) and pressure (1.3 × 10(-3) to 10(2) atm) by solving the time-dependent multiple-well master equation. The "well merging" phenomenon was observed and analyzed for its influence on the branching ratios and rate coefficients. The theoretical predictions were compared with the available experimental and theoretical data and any discrepancies were analyzed. The predicted rate coefficients are represented with forms that may readily be used in combustion modeling of n-butanol.},

Helium-filled bubbles, serving as neutrally buoyant flow tracer particles, enter the cylinder along with the inducted air charge. The bubble motion is recorded by stereo cine photography through the transparent cylinder of a specially designed research engine. Quantitative data on the 3-D velocity field generated during induction is obtained from frame-to-frame analysis of the stereo images, taking into account refraction of the rays due to the transparent cylinder. Other applications for which this technique appears suitable include measurements of velocity fields within intake ports and flow-field dynamics within intake manifolds of multicylinder engines.},

abstract = {Biofuels, such as bio-ethanol, bio-butanol, and biodiesel, are of increasing interest as alternatives to petroleum-based transportation fuels because they offer the long-term promise of fuel-source regenerability and reduced climatic impact. Current discussions emphasize the processes to make such alternative fuels and fuel additives, the compatibility of these substances with current fuel-delivery infrastructure and engine performance, and the competition between biofuel and food production. However, the combustion chemistry of the compounds that constitute typical biofuels, including alcohols, ethers, and esters, has not received similar public attention. Herein we highlight some characteristic aspects of the chemical pathways in the combustion of prototypical representatives of potential biofuels. The discussion focuses on the decomposition and oxidation mechanisms and the formation of undesired, harmful, or toxic emissions, with an emphasis on transportation fuels. New insights into the vastly diverse and complex chemical reaction networks of biofuel combustion are enabled by recent experimental investigations and complementary combustion modeling. Understanding key elements of this chemistry is an important step towards the intelligent selection of next-generation alternative fuels.},

Combustion by-products represent global human and environmental health challenges that are relevant not only in heavily industrialized nations, but also in developing nations where up to 90\% of rural households rely on unprocessed biomass fuels for cooking, warmth, and light. These issues were addressed at the Seventh International Congress on Combustion By-Products, which convened 4-6 June 2001 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. This congress included a diverse group of multidisciplinary researchers and practitioners who discussed recent developments and future goals in the control of combustion by-products and their effects of exposure on human and ecologic health. Participants recommended that interdisciplinary, coordinated research efforts should be focused to capitalize on the important potential synergisms between efforts to reduce the adverse human health effects linked to exposures to combustion by-products and broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save energy through efficiency. In this article we summarize the principal findings and recommendations for research focus and direction.},

abstract = {Fundamentally, the dehydration reaction of tertiary-butanol is frequently used as an internal standard for relative rate studies of other decomposition reactions. We report here a study using radical trappers to isolate this path in tertiary-butanol pyrolysis experiments conducted in the Princeton variable pressure flow reactor between 658 and 980 K. A novel technique that determines the rate constant value by applying a global least-squares fit incorporating all experimental species (tertiary-butanol, isobutene, and water) evolution data is developed and applied to yield six rate constant values at two reaction pressures (6.1 and 18 atm) and at temperatures between 949 and 980 K. Data from previously reported studies are reanalyzed to evaluate their "absolute" uncertainties, and new Arrhenius parameters are derived based upon the present and previous measurements. The recommended rate constant (uncertainties) for the dehydration reaction is k = 2.88(0.91) × 10(7)T(2.21(0.10)) s(-1) exp(-62.4(0.9) kcal mol(-1)/RT). The new correlation is in excellent agreement with other independent experimental and theoretical studies appearing in the literature.},

@article{Dockery1993,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported associations between particulate air pollution and daily mortality rates. Population-based, cross-sectional studies of metropolitan areas in the United States have also found associations between particulate air pollution and annual mortality rates, but these studies have been criticized, in part because they did not directly control for cigarette smoking and other health risks. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the effects of air pollution on mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors. Survival analysis, including Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8111 adults in six U.S. cities. RESULTS: Mortality rates were most strongly associated with cigarette smoking. After adjusting for smoking and other risk factors, we observed statistically significant and robust associations between air pollution and mortality. The adjusted mortality-rate ratio for the most polluted of the cities as compared with the least polluted was 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.47). Air pollution was positively associated with death from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but not with death from other causes considered together. Mortality was most strongly associated with air pollution with fine particulates, including sulfates. CONCLUSIONS: Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities.},

abstract = {Combustion of renewable biofuels, including energy-dense biodiesel, is expected to contribute significantly toward meeting future energy demands in the transportation sector. Elucidating detailed reaction mechanisms will be crucial to understanding biodiesel combustion, and hydrogen abstraction reactions are expected to dominate biodiesel combustion during ignition. In this work, we investigate hydrogen abstraction by the radicals H·, CH(3)·, O·, HO(2)·, and OH· from methyl formate, the simplest surrogate for complex biodiesels. We evaluate the H abstraction barrier heights and reaction enthalpies, using multireference correlated wave function methods including size-extensivity corrections and extrapolation to the complete basis set limit. The barrier heights predicted for abstraction by H·, CH(3)·, and O· are in excellent agreement with derived experimental values, with errors ≤1 kcal/mol. We also predict the reaction energetics for forming reactant complexes, transition states, and product complexes for reactions involving HO(2)· and OH·. High-pressure-limit rate constants are computed using transition state theory within the separable-hindered-rotor approximation for torsions and the harmonic oscillator approximation for other vibrational modes. The predicted rate constants differ significantly from those appearing in the latest combustion kinetics models of these reactions.},

The accurate treatment of hindered rotors for molecules having multiple internal rotors with potentials that are not independent of each other can be problematic, and a simplified scheme is suggested to treat them. This is particularly important for hydroperoxyalkylperoxy radicals (HOOQOO). Two new thermochemical group values are suggested in this paper, and with these values, the group additivity method for calculation of enthalpy as implemented in reaction mechanism generator (RMG) gives good agreement with CBS-QB3 predictions. The barrier heights follow the Evans-Polanyi relationship for each type of intramolecular hydrogen migration reaction studied.},

abstract = {The C-H bond dissociation processes of n-hexane and isohexane involve 23 and 13 conformational structures, respectively in the parent molecules and 14-45 conformational structures in each of the seven isomeric products that we studied. Here we use the recently developed multi-structural (MS) thermodynamics method and CCSD(T)-F12a/jul-cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/6-311+G(2df,2p) potential energy surfaces to calculate the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity of n-hexane, isohexane, and seven of the possible radical products of dissociation of C-H bonds. We compare our calculations with the limited experimental data and with values obtained by group additivity fits used to extend the experimental data. This work shows that using the MS method involving a full set of structural isomers with density functional geometries, scaled density functional frequencies, and coupled cluster single-point energies can predict thermodynamic functions of complex molecules and bond dissociation reactions with chemical accuracy. The method should be useful to obtain thermodynamic data for complex molecules for which such data has not been measured and to obtain thermodynamic data at temperatures outside the temperature range where measurements are available.},

@article{Alonso2012,
abstract = {Secondary mass savings are mass reductions that may be achieved in supporting (load-bearing) vehicle parts when the gross vehicle mass (GVM) is reduced. Mass decompounding is the process by which it is possible to identify further reductions when secondary mass savings result in further reduction of GVM. Maximizing secondary mass savings (SMS) is a key tool for maximizing vehicle fuel economy. In today's industry, the most complex parts, which require significant design detail (and cost), are designed first and frozen while the rest of the development process progresses. This paper presents a tool for estimating SMS potential early in the design process and shows how use of the tool to set SMS targets early, before subsystems become locked in, maximizes mass savings. The potential for SMS in current passenger vehicles is estimated with an empirical model using engineering analysis of vehicle components to determine mass-dependency. Identified mass-dependent components are grouped into subsystems, and linear regression is performed on subsystem mass as a function of GVM. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to determine the mean and 5th and 95th percentiles for the SMS potential per kilogram of primary mass saved. The model projects that the mean theoretical secondary mass savings potential is 0.95 kg for every 1 kg of primary mass saved, with the 5th percentile at 0.77 kg/kg when all components are available for redesign. The model was used to explore an alternative scenario where realistic manufacturing and design limitations were implemented. In this case study, four key subsystems (of 13 total) were locked-in and this reduced the SMS potential to a mean of 0.12 kg/kg with a 5th percentile of 0.1 kg/kg. Clearly, to maximize the impact of mass reduction, targets need to be established before subsystems become locked in.},

abstract = {Alternative microbial hosts have been engineered as biocatalysts for butanol biosynthesis. The butanol synthetic pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum was first re-constructed in Escherichia coli to establish a baseline for comparison to other hosts. Whereas polycistronic expression of the pathway genes resulted in the production of 34 mg/L butanol, individual expression of pathway genes elevated titers to 200 mg/L. Improved titers were achieved by co-expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae formate dehydrogenase while overexpression of E. coli glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to elevate glycolytic flux improved titers to 580 mg/L. Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis were also explored as alternative production hosts. Polycistronic expression of butanol biosynthetic genes yielded butanol titers of 120 and 24 mg/L from P. putida and B. subtilis, respectively. Production in the obligate aerobe P. putida was dependent upon expression of bcd-etfAB. These results demonstrate the potential of engineering butanol biosynthesis in a variety of heterologous microorganisms, including those cultivated aerobically.},

abstract = {Over the last century humans have altered the export of fluvial materials leading to significant changes in morphology, chemistry, and biology of the coastal ocean. Here we present sedimentary, paleoenvironmental and paleogenetic evidence to show that the Black Sea, a nearly enclosed marine basin, was affected by land use long before the changes of the Industrial Era. Although watershed hydroclimate was spatially and temporally variable over the last \~{}3000 years, surface salinity dropped systematically in the Black Sea. Sediment loads delivered by Danube River, the main tributary of the Black Sea, significantly increased as land use intensified in the last two millennia, which led to a rapid expansion of its delta. Lastly, proliferation of diatoms and dinoflagellates over the last five to six centuries, when intensive deforestation occurred in Eastern Europe, points to an anthropogenic pulse of river-borne nutrients that radically transformed the food web structure in the Black Sea.},

abstract = {The photoionization of 1-alkenylperoxy radicals, which are peroxy radicals where the OO moiety is bonded to an sp2-hybridized carbon, is studied by experimental and computational methods and compared to the similar alkylperoxy systems. Quantum chemical calculations are presented for the ionization energy and cation stability of several alkenylperoxy radicals. Experimental measurements of 1-cyclopentenylperoxy (1-c-C5H7OO) and propargylperoxy (CH2=C=CHOO) photoionization are presented as examples. These radicals are produced by reaction of an excess of O2 with pulsed-photolytically produced alkenyl radicals. The kinetic behavior of the products confirms the formation of the alkenylperoxy radicals. Electronic structure calculations are employed to give structural parameters and energetics that are used in a Franck-Condon (FC) spectral simulation of the photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves. The calculations also serve to identify the isomeric species probed by the experiment. Adiabatic ionization energies (AIEs) of 1-c-C5H7OO (8.70 +/- 0.05 eV) and CH2=C=CHOO (9.32 +/- 0.05 eV) are derived from fits to the experimental PIE curves. From the fitted FC simulation superimposed on the experimental PIE curves, the splitting between the ground state singlet and excited triplet cation electronic states is also derived for 1-c-C5H7OO (0.76 +/- 0.05 eV) and CH2=C=CHOO (0.80 +/- 0.15 eV). The combination of the AIE(CH2=C=CHOO) and the propargyl heat of formation provides Delta f H(0)(o) (CH2=C=CHOO+) of (1162 +/- 8) kJ mol-1. From Delta f H(0)(o) (CH2=C=CHOO+) and Delta f H (0)(o) (C3H3+) it is also possible to extract the bond energy D(0)(o)(C3H3+-OO) of 19 kJ mol-1 (0.20 eV). Finally, from consideration of the relevant molecular orbitals, the ionization behavior of alkyl- and alkenylperoxy radicals can be generalized with a simple rule: Alkylperoxy radicals dissociatively ionize, with the exception of methylperoxy, whereas alkenylperoxy radicals have stable singlet ground electronic state cations.},

abstract = {Molecular-beam synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry and electron-ionization mass spectrometry are used for measurements of species mole fraction profiles for low-pressure premixed dimethyl ether (DME) flames with equivalence ratios ranging from near-stoichiometric conditions (Phi = 0.93) to fuel-rich flames near the limits of flat-flame stability (Phi = 1.86). The results are compared with predictions of a recently modified kinetic model for DME combustion [Zhao et al., Int. J. Chem. Kinet., 2008, 40, 1-18] that has been extensively tested against laminar flame speed measurements, jet-stirred reactor experiments, pyrolysis and oxidation experiments in flow reactors, species measurements for burner-stabilized flames and ignition delay measurements in shock tubes. The present comprehensive measurements of the composition of reaction intermediates over a broad range of equivalence ratios considerably extends the range of the previous experiments used for validation of this model and allows for an accurate determination of contributions of individual reactions to the formation or destruction of any given flame species. The excellent agreement between measurements and predictions found for all major and most intermediate species over the entire range of equivalence ratios provides a uniquely sensitive test of details of the kinetic model. The dependence on equivalence ratio of the characteristic reaction paths in DME flames is examined within the framework of reaction path analyses.},

abstract = {A theoretical model chemistry designed to achieve high accuracy for enthalpies of formation of atoms and small molecules is described. This approach is entirely independent of experimental data and contains no empirical scaling factors, and includes a treatment of electron correlation up to the full coupled-cluster singles, doubles, triples and quadruples approach. Energies are further augmented by anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies, a scalar relativistic correction, first-order spin-orbit coupling, and the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. The accuracy of the approach is assessed by several means. Enthalpies of formation (at 0 K) calculated for a test suite of 31 atoms and molecules via direct calculation of the corresponding elemental formation reactions are within 1 kJ mol(-1) to experiment in all cases. Given the quite different bonding environments in the product and reactant sides of these reactions, the results strongly indicate that even greater accuracy may be expected in reactions that preserve (either exactly or approximately) the number and types of chemical bonds.},

@article{Skodje2010,
abstract = {A new technique is proposed that uses theoretical methods to systematically improve the performance of chemical kinetic mechanisms. Using a screening method, the chemical reaction steps that most strongly influence a given kinetic observable are identified. The associated rate coefficients are then improved by high-level quantum chemistry and transition-state-theory calculations, which leads to new values for the coefficients and smaller uncertainty ranges. This updating process is continued as new reactions emerge as the most important steps in the target observable. The screening process employed is a global sensitivity analysis that involves Monte Carlo sampling of the full N-dimensional uncertainty space of rate coefficients, where N is the number of reaction steps. The method is applied to the methanol combustion mechanism of Li et al. (Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 2007, 39, 109.). It was found that the CH(3)OH + HO(2) and CH(3)OH + O(2) reactions were the most important steps in setting the ignition delay time, and the rate coefficients for these reactions were updated. The ignition time is significantly changed for a broad range of high-concentration methanol/oxygen mixtures in the updated mechanism.},

Cyclopentenol (cyclopenten-1-ol, 1-c-C(5)H(7)OH) and its isomers cyclopenten-2-ol (2-c-C(5)H(7)OH) and cyclopentanone (c-C(5)H(8)=O), are detected from OH-initiated cyclopentene oxidation. The measured adiabatic ionization energy (AIE) of 1-c-C(5)H(7)OH is 8.4(+/-0.1) eV, and that of 2-c-C(5)H(7)OH is 9.5(+/-0.1) eV. The calculated AIE of possible cyclopentene oxidation products cis-1,2-epoxycyclopentane and 2,3-epoxycyclopentanol is 9.97 and 9.44 eV, respectively. Product spectra from OH-initiated oxidation of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene show a substantial contribution from linear aldehydes, indicating a prominent role for ring opening. Implications for the oxidation chemistry of cycloalkenes are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We have demonstrated that the near-infrared and infrared absorptions in the 8000-3200 cm(-1) region of an OH group of 2-nonanol, 1-nonanol, etc., in n-heptane are excellently separated by subtraction without any serious interference down to very low concentrations at which OH groups are completely free. The separated sharp absorptions are assigned to the fundamental, combination, and overtone bands that are concerned with the OH stretching of free OH. Two components of a sharp overtone band around 7100 cm(-1), which are observed for primary and secondary alcohols, are assigned to coexisting internal rotational isomers of an OH group around the O-C bond. The frequencies of the OH stretching fundamental and overtone bands that are assigned to internal rotational positions are consistent for all the investigated alcohols, including methanol and tertiary butanol. Comparison of the separated spectrum of 2-nonanol in n-heptane with that in 1-chlorooctane or in carbon tetrachloride makes it clear that hydrocarbon is an inert solvent that does not disturb the intrinsic nature of an alcohol OH group. There actually exists a constant anharmonicity shift of 169-175 cm(-1) between the double frequency (2nu(OH)o) of the observed fundamental and the observed overtone frequency ([2nu(OH)]o) for free OH of various alcohols in n-heptane.},

abstract = {Bioenergies are promoted across the globe as the answer for global warming and the chance to reduce dependency from fossil energy sources. Despite the fact that renewable energy sources offer the opportunity to reduce CO2 emission and present a chance to increase agricultural incomes, they also come along with some drawbacks that have been mostly neglected in the current discussion. This paper seeks to build a basis for discussing the impacts of the growing subsidization of bioenergy and the resulting usage competition of agricultural raw materials between foods and energy. To assess the usage competition and the subsidization of bioenergy, this article employs a welfare economics perspective associated with an emphasize on the construct of externalities. This will help to foster the discussion on the further subsidization of bioenergy, where funding for R\&D on new ways of using non-food raw materials ought to play a significant role.},

@article{Heyne2013a,
abstract = {A general method to evaluate the absolute uncertainties in temperatures derived using chemical thermometry is developed and applied to the retro Diels-Alder reaction of cyclohexene. Experiments from previous studies of this reaction are reanalyzed to establish the minimum absolute uncertainty limit. Chemical thermometry results are compared with thermocouple measurements in experiments performed in a flow reactor at 6.1 atm pressure and at temperatures from 957 to 978 K . Using conservative uncertainty estimates, our analysis yields absolute (1$\sigma$) uncertainties of temperature through chemical thermometry using this reaction greater than ±20 at 1000 K. Neither more refined experimental techniques nor computational theory is likely to refine rate correlation parameters sufficiently to reach the absolute temperature uncertainties often reported in the literature for chemical thermometry using the retro Diels-Alder reaction of cyclohexene. Published chemical thermometry uncertainty estimates typically have not quantitatively considered the absolute uncertainties of the original data from which the reference rate correlations were based.},

In the first part, the performance of current models, especially in terms of the prediction of pollutant formation, is evaluated. In the next parts, recent methods and ways to improve these models are described. An emphasis is given on the development of detailed models based on elementary reactions, on the production of the related thermochemical and kinetic parameters, and on the experimental techniques available to produce the data necessary to evaluate model predictions under well defined conditions (212 references).},

@article{Dames2013a,
abstract = {$\alpha$-Hydroxyalkyl radical intermediates (RCHOH, R = H, CH3, etc.) are common to the combustion of nearly all oxygenated fuels. Despite their importance in modeling the combustion phenomena of these compounds through detailed kinetic models, the unimolecular decomposition kinetics remains uncertain for even the simplest $\alpha$-hydroxyalkyl radical, hydroxymethyl (CH2OH). In this study, RRKM/master equation simulations were carried out for CH2OH decomposition to formaldehyde + H between N2 pressures of 0.01-100 atm and temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1800 K. These simulations were guided by methoxy (CH3O) decomposition calculations between pressures of 0.01-100 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 1200 K, in both helium and nitrogen. Excellent agreement of the methoxy results was observed for all regions where experimental data exist. Rates were parametrized as a function of both density and temperature within the Troe formalism. Temperature- and pressure-dependent uncertainty estimates are provided, with the largest source of uncertainty being tunneling contributions at very low pressures and at the lowest temperatures. In the regimes relevant to combustion, uncertainties range from factors of 1.4-2 for CH3O decomposition, and from 1.5-2.6 for CH2OH decomposition. The results of this study are expected to have an impact on the high temperature combustion modeling of methanol, as formation rates to CH2O + H from CH2OH are notably different from previous estimates under some conditions.},

abstract = {Living systems have evolved remarkable molecular functions that can be redesigned for in vivo chemical synthesis as we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biochemical principles for de novo construction of synthetic pathways. We have focused on developing pathways for next-generation biofuels as they require carbon to be channeled to product at quantitative yields. However, these fatty acid-inspired pathways must manage the highly reversible nature of the enzyme components. For targets in the biodiesel range, the equilibrium can be driven to completion by physical sequestration of an insoluble product, which is a mechanism unavailable to soluble gasoline-sized products. In this work, we report the construction of a chimeric pathway assembled from three different organisms for the high-level production of n-butanol (4,650 ± 720 mg l⁻¹) that uses an enzymatic chemical reaction mechanism in place of a physical step as a kinetic control element to achieve high yields from glucose (28\%).},

Because various metabolic routes that lead to the formation of a range of short-chain alcohols can be used in this approach, we refer to it as the photanol approach. Various strategies can be explored to optimize this biofuel production strategy.},

@article{Hansen2009a,
abstract = {The center of DNA three-way junctions, constituting a yoctoliter (10(-24) L) volume, is applied as an efficient reactor to create DNA-encoded libraries of chemical products. Amino acids and short peptides are linked to oligonucleotides via cleavable and noncleavable linkers. The oligonucleotide sequences contain two universal assembling domains at the center and a distal codon sequence specific for the attached building block. Stepwise self-assembly and chemical reactions of these conjugates in a combinatorial fashion create a library of pentapeptides in DNA three-way junctions in a single reaction vessel. We demonstrate the formation of an evenly distributed library of 100 peptides. Each library member contains a short synthetic peptide attached to a unique genetic code creating the necessary "genotype-phenotype" linkage essential to the process of in vitro molecular evolution. Selective enrichment of the [Leu]-enkephalin peptide from an original frequency of 1 in 10 million in a model library to a final frequency of 1.7\% in only two rounds of affinity selection is described and demonstrates successful molecular evolution for a non-natural system.},

@article{Yu2012,
abstract = {We have employed electronic structure calculations and the recently proposed multi-structural (MS) anharmonicity method to calculate partition functions and thermodynamic quantities, in particular entropy and heat capacity, for n-heptane and isoheptane. We included all structures, of which there are 59 for n-heptane and 37 for isoheptane, and we carried out the calculations both in the local harmonic approximation and by including torsional (T) anharmonicity. In addition, $\Delta$S°, $\Delta$H, and $\Delta$G° for the isomerization reaction between these two species were also calculated. It is found that all calculated thermodynamic quantities based on the MS-T approximation in the temperature range from 298 K to 1500 K agree well with experimental data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) tables or Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) data series and with values obtained from Benson's empirical parameters fit to experiment. This demonstrates not only the high accuracy of the electronic structure calculations but also that the MS-T method can be used to include both multiple-structure anharmonicity and torsional anharmonicity in the calculation of thermodynamic properties for complex molecules that contain many torsions. It also gives us confidence that we can apply the MS-T statistical thermodynamic method to obtain thermodynamic properties (i) over a broader temperature range than that for which data are available in the API tables, TRC data series, or from empirical estimation and (ii) to the many molecules for which experimental data are not available at any temperature.},

abstract = {Uncertainty importance measures are quantitative tools aiming at identifying the contribution of uncertain inputs to output uncertainty. Their application ranges from food safety (Frey \& Patil (2002)) to hurricane losses (Iman et al. (2005a, 2005b)). Results and indications an analyst derives depend on the method selected for the study. In this work, we investigate the assumptions at the basis of various indicator families to discuss the information they convey to the analyst/decisionmaker. We start with nonparametric techniques, and then present variance-based methods. By means of an example we show that output variance does not always reflect a decisionmaker state of knowledge of the inputs. We then examine the use of moment-independent approaches to global sensitivity analysis, i.e., techniques that look at the entire output distribution without a specific reference to its moments. Numerical results demonstrate that both moment-independent and variance-based indicators agree in identifying noninfluential parameters. However, differences in the ranking of the most relevant factors show that inputs that influence variance the most are not necessarily the ones that influence the output uncertainty distribution the most.},

@article{Zhang2012c,
abstract = {We studied the reaction of phenyl radicals (C(6)H(5)) with propylene (C(3)H(6)) exploiting a high temperature chemical reactor under combustion-like conditions (300 Torr, 1200-1500 K). The reaction products were probed in a supersonic beam by utilizing tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation from the Advanced Light Source and recording the photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves at mass-to-charge ratios of m/z = 118 (C(9)H(10)(+)) and m/z = 104 (C(8)H(8)(+)). Our results suggest that the methyl and atomic hydrogen losses are the two major reaction pathways with branching ratios of 86 ± 10\% and 14 ± 10\%. The isomer distributions were probed by fitting the recorded PIE curves with a linear combination of the PIE curves of the individual C(9)H(10) and C(8)H(8) isomers. Styrene (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(3)) was found to be the exclusive product contributing to m/z = 104 (C(8)H(8)(+)), whereas 3-phenylpropene, cis-1-phenylpropene, and 2-phenylpropene with branching ratios of 96 ± 4\%, 3 ± 3\%, and 1 ± 1\% could account for the signal at m/z = 118 (C(9)H(10)(+)). Although searched for carefully, no evidence of the bicyclic indane molecule could be provided. The reaction mechanisms and branching ratios are explained in terms of electronic structure calculations nicely agreeing with a recent crossed molecular beam study on this system.},

@article{Ismail2009,
abstract = {The rate coefficient for the self-reaction of vinyl radicals has been measured by two independent methods. The rate constant as a function of temperature at 20 Torr has been determined by a laser-photolysis/laser absorption technique. Vinyl iodide is photolyzed at 266 nm, and both the vinyl radical and the iodine atom photolysis products are monitored by laser absorption. The vinyl radical concentration is derived from the initial iodine atom concentration, which is determined by using the known absorption cross section of the iodine atomic transition to relate the observed absorption to concentration. The measured rate constant for the self-reaction at room temperature is approximately a factor of 2 lower than literature recommendations. The reaction displays a slightly negative temperature dependence, which can be represented by a negative activation energy, (E(a)/R) = -400 K. The laser absorption results are supported by independent experiments at 298 K and 4 Torr using time-resolved synchrotron-photoionization mass-spectrometric detection of the products of divinyl ketone and methyl vinyl ketone photolysis. The photoionization mass spectrometry experiments additionally show that methyl + propargyl are formed in the vinyl radical self-reaction, with an estimated branching fraction of 0.5 at 298 K and 4 Torr.},

abstract = {Fuel decomposition and benzene formation processes in a premixed, laminar, low-pressure, fuel-rich flame of 1-hexene (C(6)H(12), CH(2)=CH-CH(2)-CH(2)-CH(2)-CH(3)) are investigated by comparing quantitative mole fraction profiles of flame species with kinetic modeling results. The premixed flame, which is stabilized on a flat-flame burner under a reduced pressure of 30 Torr (= 40 mbar), is analyzed by flame-sampling molecular-beam time-of-flight mass spectrometry which uses photoionization by tunable vacuum-ultraviolet synchrotron radiation. The temperature profile of the flame is measured by OH laser-induced fluorescence. The model calculations include the latest rate coefficients for 1-hexene decomposition (J. H. Kiefer et al., J. Phys. Chem. A, 2009, 113, 13570) and for the propargyl (C(3)H(3)) + allyl (a-C(3)H(5)) reaction (J. A. Miller et al., J. Phys. Chem. A, 2010, 114, 4881). The predicted mole fractions as a function of distance from the burner are acceptable and often even in very good agreement with the experimentally observed profiles, thus allowing an assessment of the importance of various fuel decomposition reactions and benzene formation routes. The results clearly indicate that in contrast to the normal reactions of fuel destruction by radical attack, 1-hexene is destroyed mainly by decomposition via unimolecular dissociation forming allyl (a-C(3)H(5)) and n-propyl (n-C(3)H(7)). Minor fuel-consumption pathways include H-abstraction reactions producing various isomeric C(6)H(11) radicals with subsequent $\beta$-scissions into C(2), C(3), and C(4) intermediates. The reaction path analysis also highlights a significant contribution through the propargyl (C(3)H(3)) + allyl (a-C(3)H(5)) reaction to the formation of benzene. In this flame, benzene is dominantly formed through H-assisted isomerization of fulvene, which itself is almost exclusively produced by the C(3)H(3) + a-C(3)H(5) reaction.},

abstract = {We derive here the form for the exact exchange energy density for a density that decays with Gaussian-type behavior at long range. This functional is intermediate between the B88 and the PW91 exchange functionals. Using this modified functional to match the form expected for Gaussian densities, we propose the X3LYP extended functional. We find that X3LYP significantly outperforms Becke three parameter Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) for describing van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions, while performing slightly better than B3LYP for predicting heats of formation, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, and total atomic energies as validated with the extended G2 set of atoms and molecules. Thus X3LYP greatly enlarges the field of applications for density functional theory. In particular the success of X3LYP in describing the water dimer (with R(e) and D(e) within the error bars of the most accurate determinations) makes it an excellent candidate for predicting accurate ligand-protein and ligand-DNA interactions.},

@article{Balabin2008,
abstract = {In this paper, an extra error source for high-quality ab initio calculation of conformation equilibrium in normal alkanes-intramolecular basis set superposition error (BSSE)-is discussed. Normal butane (n-butane) and normal hexane (n-hexane) are used as representative examples. Single-point energy difference and BSSE values of trans and gauche conformations for n-butane (and trans-trans-trans and gauche-gauche-gauche conformations for n-hexane) were calculated using popular electron correlation methods: The second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2), the fourth-order Moller-Plesset (MP4), and coupled cluster with single and double substitutions with noniterative triple excitation [CCSD(T)] levels of theory. Extrapolation to the complete basis set is applied. The difference between BSSE-corrected and uncorrected relative energy values ranges from approximately 100 cal/mol (in case of n-butane) to more than 1000 cal/mol (in case of n-hexane). The influence of basis set type (Pople or Dunning) and size [up to 6-311G(3df,3pd) and aug-cc-pVQZ] is discussed.},

The test compounds include alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alkanes, alkenes, and cycloalkanes ranging in size from methanol to isododecane. Sooting tendency was characterized with a new method based on measuring particle concentrations in methane/air nonpremixed flames when 1000 ppm of each test compound was added to the fuel. This method offers high precision and high sensitivity to the direct chemical effects of the additive. The results provide a wide-ranging yet detailed quantitative picture of how fuel oxygen affects soot formation, which will be useful for optimizing the soot-reducing benefits of oxygenated renewable fuels. The measured sooting tendencies of 1-alcohols are similar to those of n-alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms, while those of secondary alcohols are slightly higher. Aldehydes and ketones soot the same as n-alkanes with one less carbon atom. The sooting tendencies of esters depend strongly on molecular structure and increase in this order: methyl and ethyl esters < carboxylic acids, propyl esters, and n-alkanes < butyl and pentyl esters. The high sooting tendencies of the secondary alcohols and higher esters suggest that four-center and six-center reaction pathways are important.},

@article{Durre2007,
abstract = {Biofuels are an attractive means to prevent a further increase of carbon dioxide emissions. Currently, gasoline is blended with ethanol at various percentages. However, butanol has several advantages over ethanol, such as higher energy content, lower water absorption, better blending ability, and use in conventional combustion engines without modification. Like ethanol, it can be produced fermentatively or petrochemically. Current crude oil prices render the biotechnological process economic again. The best-studied bacterium to perform a butanol fermentation is Clostridium acetobutylicum. Its genome has been sequenced, and the regulation of solvent formation is under intensive investigation. This opens the possibility to engineer recombinant strains with superior biobutanol-producing ability.},

@article{Wang2008a,
abstract = {This work provides experimental evidence on how the molecular compositions of fuel-rich low-pressure premixed flames are influenced as the oxygenates dimethyl ether (DME) or ethanol are incrementally blended into the propene fuel. Ten different flames with a carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 0.5, ranging from 100\% propene (phi = 1.5) to 100\% oxygenated fuel (phi = 2.0), are analyzed with flame-sampling molecular-beam mass spectrometry employing electron- or photoionization. Absolute mole fraction profiles for flame species with masses ranging from m/z = 2 (H2) to m/z = 80 (C6H8) are analyzed with particular emphasis on the formation of harmful emissions. Fuel-specific destruction pathways, likely to be initiated by hydrogen abstraction, appear to lead to benzene from propene combustion and to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde through DME and ethanol combustion, respectively. While the concentration of acetaldehyde increases 10-fold as propene is substituted by ethanol, it decreases as propene is replaced with DME. In contrast, the formaldehyde concentration rises only slightly with ethanol replacement but increases markedly with addition of DME. Allyl and propargyl radicals, the dominant precursors for benzene formation, are likely to be produced directly from propene decomposition or via allene and propyne. Benzene formation through propargyl radicals formed via unsaturated C2 intermediates in the decomposition of DME and ethanol is negligibly small. As a consequence, DME and ethanol addition lead to similar reductions of the benzene concentration.},

abstract = {We have investigated the mechanism of the reaction of H abstraction from n-butanol by the hydroxyl radical (HO*) using high level ab initio methods in conjunction with the correlation consistent basis sets up to quadruple-zeta quality (cc-pVQZ). This reaction is of significance in the atmosphere and combustion. The focus of the study has been on the relative importance of the abstractions from the specific n-butanol sites and on the role of reaction intermediates involved. Our results show that abstractions from the C(alpha) and C(gamma) positions are kinetically most favored and nearly barrierless, with barrier height estimates of 0.10 and 0.47 kcal/mol, respectively, at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ level. We have determined that the indicated barrier height order, C(alpha) < C(gamma) < C(beta) < C(delta) < OH, parallels that for the n-butanol bond dissociation energies established recently. The kinetically and thermodynamically most favored C(alpha) abstraction occurs via a mechanism including the formation of the n-butanol...HO* prereaction complex. The weakly bound postreaction complexes between the product radicals and H(2)O have been identified for all the specific site abstraction reactions, with their calculated CCSD(T) binding energies of up to about 3 kcal/mol after correcting for the basis set superposition error. G3 method has been found to yield consistent results with those obtained from the CCSD(T) calculations for the predicted orders of both the H abstraction barrier heights and their exothermicities.},

abstract = {The title study investigates the combustion characteristics of moist H2/oxidizer and moist H2/CO/oxidizer mixtures. It involves experimental determination of laminar flame speeds with emphasis on the effect of moisture addition (0–35\% in fuel mixture) using a counterflow burner apparatus. Autoignition delays of H2/oxidizer mixtures at high pressure (10, 30 and 70 bar) and intermediate temperature (907–1048K) are also experimentally determined using a new Rapid Compression Machine (RCM). The H2/oxidizer mixture is further studied with 0–40\% molar concentration of moisture in the mixtures to determine the effect of water addition on ignition delay at various post compression pressures. This new RCM is designed to attain higher post compression pressures (up to 140 bar) and wider compression ratios (5–25) compared to its predecessor. Experimental results provide extensive high fidelity data for H2/oxidizer and H2/CO/oxidizer mixtures with a wide range of water addition. It can be used for the refinement of the H2/CO/O2 combustion chemistry which not only is important for simulating syngas or high hydrogen content (HHC) fuel combustion but also forms the basic building block of the hydrocarbon chemistry. Additionally, a laser absorption setup meant for in-situ, real-time, non-intrusive measurement of temperature and important species in RCM is designed using a Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) in the mid-IR region. The transition lines of water near 7.6 $\mu$m are used for the temperature and species measurements. A calibration test cell similar in dimension to the RCM reaction chamber is used to determine the line strengths and line broadening parameters in different bath gases required for the RCM study. The method of temperature and species concentration measurements in RCM is developed and demonstrated for non-reactive as well as reactive mixtures. Detailed discussions on uncertainty analysis for the temperature and species concentration measurements are also presented.},

abstract = {A fuel-rich, nonsooting, premixed laminar cyclopentene flame (phi = 2.0) at 37.6 Torr (50 mbar) is investigated by flame-sampling photoionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry utilizing vacuum-ultraviolet synchrotron radiation. Mole fractions as a function of distance from the burner are measured for 49 intermediates with ion masses ranging from 2 (H2) to 106 (C8H10), providing a broad database for flame modeling studies. The isomeric composition is resolved for most species, and the identification of several C4Hx, C7H6, and C7H8 isomers is discussed in detail. The presence of C5H5CCH/C5H4CCH2 and cycloheptatriene is revealed by comparisons between flame-sampled photoionization efficiency data and theoretical simulations, based on calculated ionization energies and Franck-Condon factors. This insight suggests a new potential molecular- weight growth mechanism that is characterized by C5-C7 ring enlargement reactions.},

abstract = {Multistructural canonical variational-transition-state theory with multidimensional tunneling (MS-CVT/MT) is employed to calculate thermal rate constants for the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from both positions of methanol by the hydroperoxyl and methyl radicals over the temperature range 100-3000 K. The M08-HX hybrid meta-generalized gradient approximation density functional and M08-HX with specific reaction parameters, both with the maug-cc-pVTZ basis set, were validated in part 1 of this study (Alecu, I. M.; Truhlar, D. G. J. Phys. Chem. A2011, 115, 2811) against highly accurate CCSDT(2)(Q)/CBS calculations for the energetics of these reactions, and they are used here to compute the properties of all stationary points and the energies, gradients, and Hessians of nonstationary points along each considered reaction path. The internal rotations in some of the transition states are found to be highly anharmonic and strongly coupled to each other, and they generate multiple structures (conformations) whose contributions are included in the partition function. It is shown that the previous estimates for these rate constants used to build kinetic models for the combustion of methanol, some of which were based on transition state theory calculations with one-dimensional tunneling corrections and harmonic-oscillator approximations or separable one-dimensional hindered rotor treatments of torsions, are appreciably different than the ones presently calculated using MS-CVT/MT. The rate constants obtained from the best MS-CVT/MT calculations carried out in this study, in which the important effects of corner cutting due to small and large reaction path curvature are captured via a microcanonical optimized multidimensional tunneling ($\mu$OMT) treatment, are recommended for future refinement of the kinetic model for methanol combustion.},

abstract = {We studied the nature of the protein binding site of rhodopsin, using two-photon spectroscopy to assign the location of the low-lying "covalent" 1Ag*- -like pi pi * state in a model rhodopsin containing a locked-11-cis chromophore. The two-photon thermal lens maximum is observed at 22,800 cm-1, approximately equal to 2000 cm-1 above the one-photon absorption maximum, indicating that the protein environment has induced a level ordering reversal of the low-lying pi pi * states relative to that observed in retinyl Schiff bases in solution. The spectroscopic results clearly indicate that the chromophore is protonated and that the binding site is uncharged. Electrostatic energy contour maps of the binding site are calculated, showing possible locations for the external counterion(s). Two models of the binding site are proposed that accommodate the available spectroscopic data. One model involves a protonated Schiff base chromophore stabilized by a single negatively charged aspartic or glutamic acid residue. A more complicated model involving two residues (one charged, the other neutral) is also proposed. The latter model is interesting because it also accommodates the observed deuterium isotope effect in the form of a proton translocation between the two residues. The translocation is assumed to be a ground state process, initiated subsequent to the photoisomerization of the chromophore and energetically driven via destabilization of the counterion environment as a result of isomerization-induced charge separation.},

abstract = {The ionization energies (IEs) for the 2-propyl (2-C(3)H(7)), phenyl (C(6)H(5)), and benzyl (C(6)H(5)CH(2)) radicals have been calculated by the wave-function-based ab initio CCSD(T)/CBS approach, which involves the approximation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit at the coupled cluster level with single and double excitations plus quasiperturbative triple excitation [CCSD(T)]. The zero-point vibrational energy correction, the core-valence electronic correction, and the scalar relativistic effect correction have been also made in these calculations. Although a precise IE value for the 2-C(3)H(7) radical has not been directly determined before due to the poor Franck-Condon factor for the photoionization transition at the ionization threshold, the experimental value deduced indirectly using other known energetic data is found to be in good accord with the present CCSD(T)/CBS prediction. The comparison between the predicted value through the focal-point analysis and the highly precise experimental value for the IE(C(6)H(5)CH(2)) determined in the previous pulsed field ionization photoelectron (PFI-PE) study shows that the CCSD(T)/CBS method is capable of providing an accurate IE prediction for C(6)H(5)CH(2), achieving an error limit of 35 meV. The benchmarking of the CCSD(T)/CBS IE(C(6)H(5)CH(2)) prediction suggests that the CCSD(T)/CBS IE(C(6)H(5)) prediction obtained here has a similar accuracy of 35 meV. Taking into account this error limit for the CCSD(T)/CBS prediction and the experimental uncertainty, the CCSD(T)/CBS IE(C(6)H(5)) value is also consistent with the IE(C(6)H(5)) reported in the previous HeI photoelectron measurement. Furthermore, the present study provides support for the conclusion that the CCSD(T)/CBS approach with high-level energy corrections can be used to provide reliable IE predictions for C(3)-C(7) hydrocarbon radicals with an uncertainty of +/-35 meV. Employing the atomization scheme, we have also computed the 0 K (298 K) heats of formation in kJ/mol at the CCSD(T)/CBS level for 2-C(3)H(7)/2-C(3)H(7) (+) ,C(6)H(5)/C(6)H(5) (+), and C(6)H(5)CH(2)/C(6)H(5)CH(2) (+) to be 105.2/822.7 (90.0/806.4), 351.4/1148.5 (340.4/1138.8), and 226.2/929.0 (210.3/912.7), respectively. Comparing these values with the available experimental values, we find that the discrepancies for the 0 and 298 K heats of formation values are < or =2.6 kJ/mol for 2-C(3)H(7)/2-C(3)H(7) (+),< or =4.1 kJ/mol for C(6)H(5)/C(6)H(5) (+), and < or =3.2 kJ//mol for C(6)H(5)CH(2)C(6)H(5)CH(2) (+).},

abstract = {Direct measurements of intermediates of ignition are challenging experimental objectives, yet such measurements are critical for understanding fuel decomposition and oxidation pathways. This work presents experimental results, obtained using the University of Michigan Rapid Compression Facility, of ignition delay times and intermediates formed during the ignition of n-butanol. Ignition delay times for stoichiometric n-butanol/O(2) mixtures with an inert/O(2) ratio of 5.64 were measured over a temperature range of 920-1040 K and a pressure range of 2.86-3.35 atm and were compared to those predicted by the recent reaction mechanism developed by Black et al. (Combust. Flame 2010, 157, 363-373). There is excellent agreement between the experimental results and model predictions for ignition delay time, within 20\% over the entire temperature range tested. Further, high-speed gas sampling and gas chromatography techniques were used to acquire and analyze gas samples of intermediate species during the ignition delay of stoichiometric n-butanol/O(2) ($\chi$(n-but) = 0.025, $\chi$(O(2)) = 0.147, $\chi$(N(2)) = 0.541, $\chi$(Ar) = 0.288) mixtures at P = 3.25 atm and T = 975 K. Quantitative measurements of mole fraction time histories of methane, carbon monoxide, ethene, propene, acetaldehyde, n-butyraldehyde, 1-butene and n-butanol were compared with model predictions using the Black et al. mechanism. In general, the predicted trends for species concentrations are consistent with measurements. Sensitivity analyses and rate of production analyses were used to identify reactions important for predicting ignition delay time and the intermediate species time histories. Modifications to the mechanism by Black et al. were explored based on recent contributions to the literature on the rate constant for the key reaction, n-butanol+OH. The results improve the model agreement with some species; however, the comparison also indicates some reaction pathways, particularly those important to ethene formation and removal, are not well captured.},

abstract = {Planar (D6h) benzene has one (1181i cm-1, b2g) and three (1844i cm-1, b2g; 462i cm-1, e2u) imaginary vibrational frequencies at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) and MP2/6-311++G levels of theory, respectively! The spurious frequencies correspond to D3d chair (b2g) and C2v boat (e2u) out-of-plane distortions. Numerous, similar examples where planar benzene is not a minimum are documented at the MP2, MP3, and CISD levels with popular Pople-type basis sets, while the RHF, B3LYP, and BLYP methods exhibit no such problems. We show that, in the sp and spd atomic-orbital limits of MP2 theory, benzene is nonplanar. The observed failure of electron correlation methods with unbalanced basis sets to predict planar minima is not unique to benzene but is also found for other pi-delocalized molecules, including pyridine, naphthalene, anthracene, the cyclopentadienyl and indenyl anions, and the tropylium cation. Detailed mathematical analysis reveals that an insidious, geometry-dependent, two-electron basis set incompleteness error (BSIE) is responsible for the problem and that balanced, correlation-consistent constructions of basis sets are generally required to ensure reliable predictions for arenes with correlated wave functions.},

abstract = {Clostridium acetobutylicum is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium with the ability to ferment starch and sugars into solvents. In the past, it has been used for industrial production of acetone and butanol, until cheap crude oil rendered petrochemical synthesis more economically feasible. Both economic (price of crude oil) and environmental aspects (carbon dioxide emissions) have caused the pendulum to swing back again. Molecular biology has allowed a detailed understanding of genes and enzymes, required for solventogenesis. Thus, construction of strains with improved fermentation ability is now possible. Advances in continuous culture technology and improved downstream processing also add to economic advantages of a new biotechnological process. Two major companies have already committed themselves to biobutanol production as a biofuel additive. Thus, butanol fermentation is on the rise again.},

Measurements are presented of major and intermediate species mole fractions in premixed, laminar flat flames using molecular-beam sampling and isomer-selective VUV-photoionization mass spectrometry. The observed intermediate species concentrations depend crucially on decomposition of the different radicals formed initially from the fuels. The methyl acetate structure leads to preferential formation of formaldehyde, while the ethyl formate isomer favors the production of acetaldehyde. Ethyl formate also yields higher concentrations of the C2 species (C2H2 and C2H4) and C4 species (C4H2 and C4H4). Benzene concentrations, while larger for ethyl formate, are at least an order of magnitude smaller for both flames than seen for simple hydrocarbon fuels (ethylene, ethane, propene, and propane).},

When combined with remote sensing and sample data, this density implies an average crustal porosity of 12\% to depths of at least a few kilometers. Lateral variations in crustal porosity correlate with the largest impact basins, whereas lateral variations in crustal density correlate with crustal composition. The low bulk crustal density allows construction of a global crustal thickness model that satisfies the Apollo seismic constraints, and with an average crustal thickness between 34 and 43 km, the bulk refractory element composition of the Moon is not required to be enriched with respect to that of Earth.},

abstract = {The reactions of the ethynyl radical (C(2)H) with propyne and allene are studied at room temperature using an apparatus that combines the tunability of the vacuum ultraviolet radiation of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with time-resolved mass spectrometry. The C(2)H radical is prepared by 193-nm photolysis of CF(3)CCH and the mass spectrum of the reacting mixture is monitored in time using synchrotron-photoionization with a dual-sector mass spectrometer. Analysis using photoionization efficiency curves allows the isomer-specific detection of individual polyynes of chemical formula C(5)H(4) produced by both reactions. The product branching ratios are estimated for each isomer. The reaction of propyne with ethynyl gives 50-70\% diacetylene (H-C[triple bond]C-C[triple bond]C-H) and 50-30\% C(5)H(4), with a C(5)H(4)-isomer distribution of 15-20\% ethynylallene (CH(2)=C=CH-C[triple bond]CH) and 85-80\% methyldiacetylene (CH(3)-C[triple bond]C-C[triple bond]CH). The reaction of allene with ethynyl gives 35-45\% ethynylallene, 20-25\% methyldiacetylene and 45-30\% 1,4-pentadiyne (HC[triple bond]C-CH(2)-C[triple bond]CH). Diacetylene is most likely not produced by this reaction; an upper limit of 30\% on the branching fraction to diacetylene can be derived from the present experiment. The mechanisms of polyynes formation by these reactions as well as the implications for Titan's atmospheric chemistry are discussed.},

abstract = {Global energy and environmental problems have stimulated increased efforts towards synthesizing biofuels from renewable resources. Compared to the traditional biofuel, ethanol, higher alcohols offer advantages as gasoline substitutes because of their higher energy density and lower hygroscopicity. In addition, branched-chain alcohols have higher octane numbers compared with their straight-chain counterparts. However, these alcohols cannot be synthesized economically using native organisms. Here we present a metabolic engineering approach using Escherichia coli to produce higher alcohols including isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-phenylethanol from glucose, a renewable carbon source. This strategy uses the host's highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway and diverts its 2-keto acid intermediates for alcohol synthesis. In particular, we have achieved high-yield, high-specificity production of isobutanol from glucose. The strategy enables the exploration of biofuels beyond those naturally accumulated to high quantities in microbial fermentation.},

@phdthesis{Hui2013a,
abstract = {This dissertation presents work on the flame propagation and extinction of various liquid hydrocarbon fuels, including conventional and alternative jet fuels, surrogate fuels, and their reference hydrocarbon components. The laminar flame speeds and extinction stretch rates are experimentally determined by using a twin-flame counterflow setup integrated with a Digital Particle Image Velocimetry system for the flow field measurement. The experimental results are also compared with computed values obtained by using various published kinetic models for different fuels. In general, most of the simulation results agree with the experimental data with an average deviation less than 10\%, which are reasonable considering the uncertainties in both experiments and kinetic models. The results of this work show that the conventional Jet-A and alternative jet fuels share very similar flame speeds and extinction limits despite of their differences in the molecular composition. The results of two surrogate mixtures for Jet-A show that they are both able to reproduce very well the flame speeds and extinction limits of the target jet fuel. Additional studies on aromatic species relevant to the conventional jet fuels illustrate that the degree and position of alkyl substitution on the benzene ring have a strong effect on the reactivity of the aromatic components studied. By extending the flame propagation studies to elevated pressures up to 3 atm, it is found that the flame speed results at elevated pressures are consistent in the trend with atmospheric results. Further attempts are made to identify and quantify the effects of preheat temperature and pressure on burning rate. This dissertation provides experimental flame speed and extinction data of high fidelity for jet fuels and relevant hydrocarbons. The fundamental data provided herein can serve as the benchmark database, and can be used in development and validation of combustion kinetic models.},

@article{Hughes2006,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show the application of global uncertainty analysis to comprehensive and reduced kinetic models as a tool to identify important thermochemical and reaction rate parameters as determinants of the conditions leading to autoignition. Propane oxidation is taken as the test case. The simulation of experimental investigations of the cool flames and two-stage ignitions, via the pressure-temperature ignition diagram, show that existing kinetic models for the low temperature combustion of propane at sub-atmospheric pressures reflect a greater reactivity than seems to be appropriate. That is, the models lead to a prediction of two-stage ignition at pressures somewhat lower and with ignition delays shorter than is found experimentally. The inconsistency between experiment and numerical simulation seems not to be an inherent problem of the qualitative structure of the models, but may derive from uncertainties in the parameters within the mechanism. By use of "brute force", Morris-one-at-a-time and Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that uncertainties in only a small number of parameters, and falling well within the errors that may reasonably be assigned, can shift the response appropriately. Moreover, it appears that in the low temperature combustion regime, thermochemistry is at least as, if not more, important than the reaction rates, yet usually receives less attention within sensitivity studies. In the present case, the main factors controlling the temperature reached in the first stage of two-stage ignition and the time to ignition appear to be connected with the thermochemistry of three specific hydroperoxyalkyl radicals and their derivatives. Other factors, such as heat and mass transport are also addressed, and their effects are mitigated to some extent by evaluation of initial and revised models against experimental data for ignition delay obtained under microgravity. The results highlight more general issues that pertain to the numerical simulation of the combustion of higher hydrocarbons and contribute to the development of the protocol necessary for testing kinetic models before they are ready for use in a predictive capacity.},

abstract = {A detailed chemical kinetic modeling approach is used to examine the phenomenon of suppression of sooting in diesel engines by the addition of oxygenated hydrocarbon species to the fuel. This suppression, which has been observed experimentally for a few years, is explained kinetically as a reduction in concentrations of soot precursors present in the hot products of a fuel-rich diesel ignition zone when oxygenates are included. The kinetic model is also used to show how different oxygenates, ester structures in particular, can have different soot-suppression efficiencies due to differences in the molecular structure of the oxygenated species.},

@article{Stranic2013a,
abstract = {The overall rate constant for the reaction tert-butanol + OH → products was determined experimentally behind reflected shock waves by using (18)O-substituted tert-butanol (tert-butan(18)ol) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a fast source of (16)OH. The data were acquired from 900 to 1200 K near 1.1 atm and are best fit by the Arrhenius expression 1.24 × 10(-10) exp(-2501/T [K]) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The products of the title reaction include the tert-C4H8OH radical that is known to have two major $\beta$-scission decomposition channels, one of which produces OH radicals. Experiments with the isotopically labeled tert-butan(18)ol also lead to an experimental determination of the branching ratio for the $\beta$-scission pathways of the tert-C4H8OH radical by comparing the measured pseudo-first-order decay rate of (16)OH in the presence of excess tert-butan(16)ol with the respective decay rate of (16)OH in the presence of excess tert-butan(18)ol. The two decay rates of (16)OH as a result of reactions with the two forms of tert-butanol differ by approximately a factor of 5 due to the absence of (16)OH-producing pathways in experiments with tert-butan(18)ol. This indicates that 80\% of the (16)OH molecules that react with tert-butan(16)ol will reproduce another (16)OH molecule through $\beta$-scission of the resulting tert-C4H8(16)OH radical. (16)OH mole fraction time histories were measured using narrow-line-width laser absorption near 307 nm. Measurements were performed at the line center of the R22(5.5) transition in the A-X(0,0) band of (16)OH, a transition that does not overlap with any absorption features of (18)OH, hence yielding a measurement of (16)OH mole fraction that is insensitive to any production of (18)OH.},

@article{Katsikadakos2012,
abstract = {Hydrogen abstraction reactions by the methyl radical from n-butanol have been investigated at the ROCBS-QB3 level of theory. Reaction energies and product geometries for the most stable conformer of n-butanol (ROH) have been computed, the reaction energies order $\alpha$ < $\gamma$ < $\beta$ < $\delta$ < OH. The preference for n-butane to favour H-abstraction at C($\beta$) and C($\gamma$) while, in contrast, n-butanol favours radical reactions at the C($\alpha$) carbon is rationalised. Transition state (TS) barriers and geometries for the most stable conformer of n-butanol are presented, and discussed with respect to the Hammond postulate. The reaction barriers order as $\alpha$ < OH < $\gamma$ < $\beta$ < $\delta$. This relative ordering is not consistent with product radical stability, C-H bond dissociation energies or previous studies using O[combining dot above]H and HO[combining dot above](2) radicals. We provide a molecular orbital based rationalisation for this ordering and answer two related questions: Why is the $\gamma$-channel more stable than the $\beta$-channel? Why do the two C($\gamma$)-H H-abstraction TS differ in energy? The method and basis set dependence of the TS barriers is investigated. The Boltzmann probability distribution for the n-butanol conformers suggests that low energy conformers are present in approximately equal proportions to the most stable conformer at combustion temperatures where ĊH(3) radicals are present. Thus, the relative significance of the various H-abstraction channels has been assessed for a selection of higher energy conformers (ROH'). Key results include finding that higher energy n-butanol conformers (E(ROH') > E(ROH)) can generate lower energy product radicals, E(ROH') < E(ROH). Moreover, higher energy conformers can also have a globally competitive TS energy for H-abstraction.},

@techreport{Yanowitz2011,
abstract = {This report reviews the use of higher alcohols and several cellulose-derived oxygenates as blend components in gasoline. Material compatibility issues are expected to be less severe for neat higher alcohols than for fuel-grade ethanol. Very little data exist on how blending higher alcohols or other oxygenates with gasoline affects ASTM Standard D4814 properties. Under the Clean Air Act, fuels used in the United States must be 'substantially similar' to fuels used in certification of cars for emission compliance. Waivers for the addition of higher alcohols at concentrations up to 3.7 wt\% oxygen have been granted. Limited emission testing on pre-Tier 1 vehicles and research engines suggests that higher alcohols will reduce emissions of CO and organics, while NOx emissions will stay the same or increase. Most oxygenates can be used as octane improvers for standard gasoline stocks. The properties of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, dimethylfuran, 2-methylfuran, methyl pentanoate and ethyl pentanoate suggest that they may function well as low-concentration blends with gasoline in standard vehicles and in higher concentrations in flex fuel vehicles.},

The M08-SO hybrid meta-GGA density functional was validated against CCSD(T)-F12a explicitly correlated wave function calculations with the jul-cc-pVTZ basis set. It was then used to compute the properties of all stationary points and the energies and Hessians of a few nonstationary points along the reaction path, which were then used to generate a potential energy surface by the multiconfiguration Shepard interpolation (MCSI) method. The internal rotations in the transition state for this reaction (like those in the reactant alcohol) are strongly coupled to each other and generate multiple stable conformations, which make important contributions to the partition functions. It is shown that neglecting to account for the multiple-structure effects and torsional potential anharmonicity effects that arise from the torsional modes would lead to order-of-magnitude errors in the calculated rate constants at temperatures of interest in combustion.},

@article{Weber2010b,
abstract = {Bioalcohols produced by microorganisms from renewable materials are promising substitutes for traditional fuels derived from fossil sources. For several years already ethanol is produced in large amounts from feedstocks such as cereals or sugar cane and used as a blend for gasoline or even as a pure biofuel. However, alcohols with longer carbon chains like butanol have even more suitable properties and would better fit with the current fuel distribution infrastructure. Moreover, ethical concerns contradict the use of food and feed products as a biofuel source. Lignocellulosic biomass, especially when considered as a waste material offers an attractive alternative. However, the recalcitrance of these materials and the inability of microorganisms to efficiently ferment lignocellulosic hydrolysates still prevent the production of bioalcohols from these plentiful sources. Obviously, no known organism exist which combines all the properties necessary to be a sustainable bioalcohol producer. Therefore, breeding technologies, genetic engineering and the search for undiscovered species are promising means to provide a microorganism exhibiting high alcohol productivities and yields, converting all lignocellulosic sugars or are even able to use carbon dioxide or monoxide, and thereby being highly resistant to inhibitors and fermentation products, and easy to cultivate in huge bioreactors. In this review, we compare the properties of various microorganisms, bacteria and yeasts, as well as current research efforts to develop a reliable lignocellulosic bioalcohol producing organism.},

@article{Hejesen2013,
abstract = {DNA-directed synthesis of encoded combinatorial libraries of small organic compounds most often involves transfer of organic building blocks from one DNA strand to another. This requires cleavable linkers to enable cleavage of the link to the original DNA strand from which the building block is transferred. Relatively few cleavable linkers are available for DNA-directed synthesis and most often they leave an amino group at the organic molecule. Here we have extended the application of aryltriazenes as traceless linkers for DNA-directed synthesis. After reaction of one building block with a building block at another DNA strand the triazene linker is cleaved and reduced with hypophosphorous acid in high yield to leave the aryl group with a hydrogen in place of the triazene i.e. without a functional group trace. It was also demonstrated that alternatively the triazene could be converted to an azide, which was used in a cycloaddition reaction. The linker is generally stable at pH > 7 and could be stored for several months in a freezer without significant degradation.},

abstract = {Photoionization mass spectrometry using tunable vacuum-ultraviolet synchrotron radiation is applied to the study of C3H2 Sampled from a rich cyclopentene flame. The photoionization efficiency has been measured between 8.5 eV and 11.0 eV. Franck-Condon factors for photoionization are calculated from B3LYP/ 6-311++-G(d,p) characterizations of the neutral and cation of the two lowest-energy C3H2 isomers, triplet propargylene (HCCCH, prop-2-ynylidene) and singlet cyclopropenylidene (cyclo-HCCCH). Comparison of the calculated Franck-Condon envelopes with the experimental photoionization efficiency spectrum determines the adiabatic ionization energy of triplet propargylene to be (8.96 +/- 0.04) eV. Ionization energies for cyclopropenylidene, propargylene and propadienylidene (H2CCC) calculated using QCISD(T) with triple-zeta and quadruple-zeta basis sets extrapolated to the infinite basis set limit are in excellent agreement with the present determination of the ionization energy for propargylene and with literature values for cyclopropenylidene and propadienylidene. The results suggest the presence of both propargylene and cyclopropenylidene in the cyclopentene flame and allow reanalysis of electron ionization measurements of C3H2 in other flames. Possible chemical pathways for C3H2 formation in these flames are briefly discussed.},

A model that was automatically generated is used as a starting point and a large number of thermochemical and kinetic data are then re-estimated. The kinetic data of the isomerization of alkylperoxy radicals giving (•)QOOH radicals and the subsequent decomposition to give cyclic ethers has been calculated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. The newly obtained model allows a satisfactory prediction of experimental data recently obtained in a jet-stirred reactor and in rapid compression machines. A considerable improvement of the prediction of the selectivity of cyclic ethers is especially obtained compared to previous models. Linear and global sensitivity analyses have been performed to better understand which reactions are of influence in the NTC zone.},

abstract = {We propose a new formulation of variational transition state theory called multipath variational transition state theory (MP-VTST). We employ this new formulation to calculate the forward and reverse thermal rate constant of the 1,4-hydrogen shift isomerization of the 2-cyclohexylethyl radical in the gas phase. First, we find and optimize all the local-minimum-energy structures of the reaction, product, and transition state. Then, for the lowest-energy transition state structures, we calculate the reaction path by using multiconfiguration Shepard interpolation (MSCI) method to represent the potential energy surface, and, from this representation, we also calculate the ground-state vibrationally adiabatic potential energy curve, the reaction-path curvature vector, and the generalized free energy of activation profile. With this information, the path-averaged generalized transmission coefficients <$\gamma$> are evaluated. Then, thermal rate constant containing the multiple-structure anharmonicity and torsional anharmonicity effects is calculated using multistructural transition state theory (MS-TST). The final MP-VTST thermal rate constant is obtained by multiplying k(MS-T)(MS-TST) by <$\gamma$>. In these calculations, the M06 density functional is utilized to compute the energy, gradient, and Hessian at the Shepard points, and the M06-2X density functional is used to obtain the structures (conformers) of the reactant, product, and the saddle point for computing the multistructural anharmonicity factors.},

@article{Thran2007,
abstract = {The intensified use of biomass as an energy source is an often-repeated goal of the German and European climate protection policy. Therefore, framework conditions have been created in recent years, which allow for a wider use of biomass within the energy system especially for a provision of electricity and fuels. Due to this policy, Germany, for example, has emerged as the leading producer of biogas from energy crops and fatty methyl ester (FAME) in Europe. However, due to the high energy price level, the use of biomass for heating purposes and as a renewable raw material have increased at the same time. To supply the obviously increased demand for biomass or biobased energy carriers cost efficiently, nationwide and to some extend even global markets are under development at present. As the demand for biomass is expected to continue to increase strongly, it is feared that an increasing competition with the use for food and fodder as well as a raw material might occur in the years to come. Against this background we have analyzed the competitions that can be expected, and the influence that they may have on the further expansion of the use of biomass for energy production. Experiences from Germany are provided exemplarily. Based on this, it is concluded that measures need to be taken to support an efficient and sustainable use of bioenergy in the future.},

Highly magnesian olivine and abundant glass containing Martian atmosphere are present in Tissint. Refractory trace element, S and F data for the matrix and glass veins in the meteorite indicate the presence of a Martian surface component. Thus, the influence of in situ Martian weathering can be unambiguously distinguished from terrestrial contamination in this meteorite. Martian weathering features in Tissint are compatible with the results of spacecraft observations of Mars. Tissint has a cosmic ray exposure age of 0.7 ± 0.3 Ma, consistent with those of many other shergottites, notably EETA79001, suggesting that they were ejected from Mars during the same event.},

abstract = {A general framework is presented for accurately and efficiently estimating the phenomenological pressure-dependent rate coefficients for reaction networks of arbitrary size and complexity using only high-pressure-limit information. Two aspects of this framework are discussed in detail. First, two methods of estimating the density of states of the species in the network are presented, including a new method based on characteristic functional group frequencies. Second, three methods of simplifying the full master equation model of the network to a single set of phenomenological rates are discussed, including a new method based on the reservoir state and pseudo-steady state approximations. Both sets of methods are evaluated in the context of the chemically-activated reaction of acetyl with oxygen. All three simplifications of the master equation are usually accurate, but each fails in certain situations, which are discussed. The new methods usually provide good accuracy at a computational cost appropriate for automated reaction mechanism generation.},

The GRAIL field reveals features not previously resolved, including tectonic structures, volcanic landforms, basin rings, crater central peaks, and numerous simple craters. From degrees 80 through 300, over 98\% of the gravitational signature is associated with topography, a result that reflects the preservation of crater relief in highly fractured crust. The remaining 2\% represents fine details of subsurface structure not previously resolved. GRAIL elucidates the role of impact bombardment in homogenizing the distribution of shallow density anomalies on terrestrial planetary bodies.},

@article{Sirjean2011,
abstract = {The role of quantum tunneling in hydrogen shift in linear heptyl radicals is explored using multidimensional, small-curvature tunneling method for the transmission coefficients and a potential energy surface computed at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Several one-dimensional approximations (Wigner, Skodje and Truhlar, and Eckart methods) were compared to the multidimensional results. The Eckart method was found to be sufficiently accurate in comparison to the small-curvature tunneling results for a wide range of temperature, but this agreement is in fact fortuitous and caused by error cancellations. High-pressure limit rate constants were calculated using the transition state theory with treatment of hindered rotations and Eckart transmission coefficients for all hydrogen-transfer isomerizations in n-pentyl to n-octyl radicals. Rate constants are found in good agreement with experimental kinetic data available for n-pentyl and n-hexyl radicals. In the case of n-heptyl and n-octyl, our calculated rates agree well with limited experimentally derived data. Several conclusions made in the experimental studies of Tsang et al. (Tsang, W.; McGivern, W. S.; Manion, J. A. Proc. Combust. Inst. 2009, 32, 131-138) are confirmed theoretically: older low-temperature experimental data, characterized by small pre-exponential factors and activation energies, can be reconciled with high-temperature data by taking into account tunneling; at low temperatures, transmission coefficients are substantially larger for H-atom transfers through a five-membered ring transition state than those with six-membered rings; channels with transition ring structures involving greater than 8 atoms can be neglected because of entropic effects that inhibit such transitions. The set of computational kinetic rates were used to derive a general rate rule that explicitly accounts for tunneling. The rate rule is shown to reproduce closely the theoretical rate constants.},

As an aim for synthetic biology, it requires mathematical models of genetic modules that could be characterized independently of their context. This fastens the design of metabolic circuits using a combinatorial design approach, where given pathways could be optimized for maximal bioproduction, while being nontoxic for the chassis. We show how recent characterization of genetic parts, such as promoters, RBS or sRNAs could be used to fine-tune the expression of individual genes to achieve that goal. We also present lists of enzymes that are used for bioproduction, enlarging such set of biological parts.},

abstract = {The reactions of the methylidyne radical (CH) with ethylene, acetylene, allene, and methylacetylene are studied at room temperature using tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization and time-resolved mass spectrometry. The CH radicals are prepared by 248 nm multiphoton photolysis of CHBr(3) at 298 K and react with the selected hydrocarbon in a helium gas flow. Analysis of photoionization efficiency versus VUV photon wavelength permits isomer-specific detection of the reaction products and allows estimation of the reaction product branching ratios. The reactions proceed by either CH insertion or addition followed by H atom elimination from the intermediate adduct. In the CH + C(2)H(4) reaction the C(3)H(5) intermediate decays by H atom loss to yield 70(+/-8)\% allene, 30(+/-8)\% methylacetylene, and less than 10\% cyclopropene, in agreement with previous RRKM results. In the CH + acetylene reaction, detection of mainly the cyclic C(3)H(2) isomer is contrary to a previous RRKM calculations that predicted linear triplet propargylene to be 90\% of the total H-atom coproducts. High-level CBS-APNO quantum calculations and RRKM calculations for the CH + C(2)H(2) reaction presented in this manuscript predict a higher contribution of the cyclic C(3)H(2) (27.0\%) versus triplet propargylene (63.5\%) than earlier predictions. Extensive calculations on the C(3)H(3) and C(3)H(2)D system combined with experimental isotope ratios for the CD + C(2)H(2) reaction indicate that H-atom-assisted isomerization in the present experiments is responsible for the remaining discrepancy between the new RRKM calculations and the experimental results. Cyclic isomers are also found to represent 30(+/-6)\% of the detected products in the case of CH + methylacetylene, together with 33(+/-6)\% 1,2,3-butatriene and 37(+/-6)\% vinylacetylene. The CH + allene reaction gives 23(+/-5)\% 1,2,3-butatriene and 77(+/-5)\% vinylacetylene, whereas cyclic isomers are produced below the detection limit in this reaction. The reaction exit channels deduced by comparing the product distributions for the aforementioned reactions are discussed in detail.},

@article{Taatjes2008,
abstract = {The combination of multiplexed mass spectrometry with photoionization by tunable-synchrotron radiation has proved to be a powerful tool to investigate elementary reaction kinetics and the chemistry of low-pressure flames. In both of these applications, multiple-mass detection and the ease of tunability of synchrotron radiation make it possible to acquire full sets of data as a function of mass, photon energy, and of the physical dimension of the system, e.g. distance from the burner or time after reaction initiation. The data are in essence an indirect image of the chemistry. The data can be quantitatively correlated and integrated along any of several dimensions to compare to traditional measurements such as time or distance profiles of individual chemical species, but it can also be directly interpreted in image form. This perspective offers an overview of flame chemistry and chemical kinetics measurements that combine tunable photoionization with multiple-mass detection, emphasizing the overall insight that can be gained from multidimensional data on these systems. The low-pressure flame apparatus is capable of providing isomer-resolved mass spectra of stable and radical species as a function of position in the flame. The overall chemical structure of the flames can be readily seen from images of the evolving mass spectrum as distance from the burner increases, with isomer-specific information given in images of the photoionization efficiency. Several flames are compared in this manner, with a focus on identification of global differences in fuel-decomposition and soot-formation pathways. Differences in the chemistry of flames of isomeric fuels can be discerned. The application of multiplexed synchrotron photoionization to elementary reaction kinetics permits identification of time-resolved isomeric composition in reacting systems. The power of this technique is illustrated by the separation of direct and dissociative ionization signals in the reaction of C(2)H(5) with O(2); by the resolution of isomeric products in reactions of the ethynyl (C(2)H) radical; and by preliminary observation of branching to methyl + propargyl products in the self-reaction of vinyl radicals. Finally, prospects for future research using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry are explored.},

abstract = {The reaction of the methylidyne radical (CH) with acetaldehyde (CH(3)CHO) is studied at room temperature and at a pressure of 4 Torr (533.3 Pa) using a multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometer coupled to the tunable vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The CH radicals are generated by 248 nm multiphoton photolysis of CHBr(3) and react with acetaldehyde in an excess of helium and nitrogen gas flow. Five reaction exit channels are observed corresponding to elimination of methylene (CH(2)), elimination of a formyl radical (HCO), elimination of carbon monoxide (CO), elimination of a methyl radical (CH(3)), and elimination of a hydrogen atom. Analysis of the photoionization yields versus photon energy for the reaction of CH and CD radicals with acetaldehyde and CH radical with partially deuterated acetaldehyde (CD(3)CHO) provides fine details about the reaction mechanism. The CH(2) elimination channel is found to preferentially form the acetyl radical by removal of the aldehydic hydrogen. The insertion of the CH radical into a C-H bond of the methyl group of acetaldehyde is likely to lead to a C(3)H(5)O reaction intermediate that can isomerize by $\beta$-hydrogen transfer of the aldehydic hydrogen atom and dissociate to form acrolein + H or ketene + CH(3), which are observed directly. Cycloaddition of the radical onto the carbonyl group is likely to lead to the formation of the observed products, methylketene, methyleneoxirane, and acrolein.},

Simulation of the kinetics of the decrease of the methyl signal and the corresponding increase of the NO signal (in combination with the NO absolute photoionization cross section determined by Watanabe (Watanabe, K.

abstract = {Reactions of hydroxybutyl radicals with O2 were investigated by a combination of quantum-chemical calculations and experimental measurements of product formation. In pulsed-photolytic Cl-initiated oxidation of n-butanol, the time-resolved and isomer-specific product concentrations were probed using multiplexed tunable synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS). The interpretation of the experimental data is underpinned by potential energy surfaces for the reactions of O2 with the four hydroxybutyl isomers (1-hydroxybut-1-yl, 1-hydroxybut-2-yl, 4-hydroxybut-2-yl, and 4-hydroxybut-1-yl) calculated at the CBS-QB3 and RQCISD(T)/cc-pV∞Z//B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) levels of theory. The observed product yields display substantial temperature dependence, arising from a competition among three fundamental pathways: (1) stabilization of hydroxybutylperoxy radicals, (2) bimolecular product formation in the hydroxybutyl + O2 reactions, and (3) decomposition of hydroxybutyl radicals. The 1-hydroxybut-1-yl + O2 reaction is dominated by direct HO2 elimination from the corresponding peroxy radical forming butanal as the stable coproduct. The chemistry of the other three hydroxybutylperoxy radical isomers mainly proceeds via alcohol-specific internal H-atom abstractions involving the H atom from either the -OH group or from the carbon attached to the -OH group. We observe evidence of the recently reported water elimination pathway (Welz et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2013, 4 (3), 350-354) from the 4-hydroxybut-2-yl + O2 reaction, supporting its importance in $\gamma$-hydroxyalkyl + O2 reactions. Experiments using the 1,1-d2 and 4,4,4-d3 isotopologues of n-butanol suggest the presence of yet unexplored pathways to acetaldehyde.},

abstract = {The production of isobutanol in microorganisms has recently been achieved by harnessing the highly active 2-keto acid pathways. Since these 2-keto acids are precursors of amino acids, we aimed to construct an isobutanol production platform in Corynebacterium glutamicum, a well-known amino-acid-producing microorganism. Analysis of this host's sensitivity to isobutanol toxicity revealed that C. glutamicum shows an increased tolerance to isobutanol relative to Escherichia coli. Overexpression of alsS of Bacillus subtilis, ilvC and ilvD of C. glutamicum, kivd of Lactococcus lactis, and a native alcohol dehydrogenase, adhA, led to the production of 2.6 g/L isobutanol and 0.4 g/L 3-methyl-1-butanol in 48 h. In addition, other higher chain alcohols such as 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 1-butanol, and 2-phenylethanol were also detected as byproducts. Using longer-term batch cultures, isobutanol titers reached 4.0 g/L after 96 h with wild-type C. glutamicum as a host. Upon the inactivation of several genes to direct more carbon through the isobutanol pathway, we increased production by approximately 25\% to 4.9 g/L isobutanol in a pycldh background. These results show promise in engineering C. glutamicum for higher chain alcohol production using the 2-keto acid pathways.},

abstract = {Since advances in the ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) fermentation process in recent years have led to significant increases in its productivity and yields, the production of butanol and its use in motor vehicles have become an option worth evaluating. This study estimates the potential life-cycle energy and emission effects associated with using bio-butanol as a transportation fuel. It employs a well-to-wheels (WTW) analysis tool: the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model. The estimates of life-cycle energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are based on an Aspen Plus(R) simulation for a corn-to-butanol production process, which describes grain processing, fermentation, and product separation. Bio-butanol-related WTW activities include corn farming, corn transportation, butanol production, butanol transportation, and vehicle operation. In this study, we also analyzed the bio-acetone that is coproduced with bio-butanol as an alternative to petroleum-based acetone. We then compared the results for bio-butanol with those of conventional gasoline. Our study shows that driving vehicles fueled with corn-based butanol produced by the current ABE fermentation process could result in substantial fossil energy savings (39\%-56\%) and avoid large percentage of the GHG emission burden, yielding a 32\%-48\% reduction relative to using conventional gasoline. On energy basis, a bushel of corn produces less liquid fuel from the ABE process than that from the corn ethanol dry mill process. The coproduction of a significant portion of acetone from the current ABE fermentation presents a challenge. A market analysis of acetone, as well as research and development on robust alternative technologies and processes that minimize acetone while increase the butanol yield, should be conducted.},

Calculations on the lowest four singlet states and the lowest four triplet states of N(2) with the sequence of n-tuple-zeta augmented polarized (nZaP) basis sets (n=2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) are used to establish the complete basis set limits. Full configuration-interaction (CI) and core electron contributions must be included for very accurate potential energy surfaces. However, a simple extrapolation scheme that has no adjustable parameters and requires nothing more demanding than CAS(10e(-),8orb)-CISD/3ZaP calculations gives the R(e), omega(e), omega(e)X(e), T(e), and D(e) for these eight states with rms errors of 0.0006 Angstrom, 4.43 cm(-1), 0.35 cm(-1), 0.063 eV, and 0.018 eV, respectively.},

abstract = {Accurate thermochemical data of small molecules are invaluable to the progress of every aspect of chemistry, especially in the atmosphere, combustion and industry. In this work, photofragmentation translational spectroscopy and 1st principles electronic structure theory reveal the literature value of the heat of formation of chlorine-isocyanate to be in error by more than 40 kcalmol. We report a revised experimental value for D0(Cl-NCO) = 51+/-3 kcal/mol which leads to a Delta Hf (ClNCO) = 8.5+/-3 kcal/mol. High level ab initio (CCSD(T)) electronic structure calculations extrapolated to the complete basis set limit give D0(Cl-NCO) = 6.3 kcal/mol, in good agreement with experiment. In light of the present results, the destabilization of azides relative to isoelectronic isocyanates has been evaluated empirically for three pairs of related molecules. It is found to be 90-110 kcal/mol, and has been attributed mainly to the weakening of the N-NN bond relative to the N-CO bond. Electronic structure calculations employing decomposition analysis suggest that, compared to homopolar N2, the (+delta)CO(-delta) pi polarity provides better orbital interaction (charge transfer) and electrostatic attraction and results in a closer encounter and larger stabilization between the fragments and that this is the origin of isoelectronic destabilization of azides relative to the isocyanates.},

abstract = {The unimolecular reactions of hydroperoxy alkyl radicals (QOOH) play a central role in the low-temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons as they compete with the addition of a second O(2) molecule, which is known to provide chain-branching. In this work we present high-pressure rate estimation rules for the most important unimolecular reactions of the $\beta$-, $\gamma$-, and $\delta$-QOOH radicals: isomerization to RO(2), cyclic ether formation, and selected $\beta$-scission reactions. These rate rules are derived from high-pressure rate constants for a series of reactions of a given reaction class. The individual rate expressions are determined from CBS-QB3 electronic structure calculations combined with canonical transition state theory calculations. Next we use the rate rules, along with previously published rate estimation rules for the reactions of alkyl peroxy radicals (RO(2)), to investigate the potential impact of falloff effects in combustion/ignition kinetic modeling. Pressure effects are examined for the reaction of n-butyl radical with O(2) by comparison of concentration versus time profiles that were obtained using two mechanisms at 10 atm: one that contains pressure-dependent rate constants that are obtained from a QRRK/MSC analysis and another that only contains high-pressure rate expressions. These simulations reveal that under most conditions relevant to combustion/ignition problems, the high-pressure rate rules can be used directly to describe the reactions of RO(2) and QOOH. For the same conditions, we also address whether the various isomers equilibrate during reaction. These results indicate that equilibrium is established between the alkyl, RO(2), and $\gamma$- and $\delta$-QOOH radicals.},

abstract = {This work presents the first direct experimental study of the rate constant for the reaction of OH with iso-butanol (2-methyl-1-propanol) at temperatures from 907 to 1147 K at near-atmospheric pressures. OH time-histories were measured behind reflected shock waves using a narrow-linewidth laser absorption method during reactions of dilute mixtures of tert-butylhydroperoxide (as a fast source of OH) with iso-butanol in excess. The title reaction's overall rate constant (OH + iso-butanol →(k(overall)) all products) minus the rate constant for the $\beta$-radical-producing channel (OH + iso-butanol →(k($\beta$)) 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-prop-2-yl radical + H(2)O) was determined from the pseudo-first-order rate of OH decay. A two-parameter Arrhenius fit of the experimentally determined rate constant in the current temperature range yields the expression (k(overall) - k($\beta$)) = 1.84 × 10(-10) exp(-2350/T[K]) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). A recommendation for the overall rate constant, including k($\beta$), is made, and comparisons of the results to rate constant recommendations from the literature are discussed.},

Many micro-organisms are capable of rapid and efficient degradation of biomass, employing a battery of specialized enzymes, but do not produce useful products. Attempts to transfer biomass-degrading capability to industrially useful organisms by heterologous expression of one or a few biomass-degrading enzymes have met with limited success. It seems probable that an effective biomass-degradation system requires the synergistic action of a large number of enzymes, the individual and collective actions of which are poorly understood. By offering the ability to combine any number of transgenes in a modular, combinatorial way, synthetic biology offers a new approach to elucidating the synergistic action of combinations of biomass-degrading enzymes in vivo and may ultimately lead to a transferable biomass-degradation system. Also, synthetic biology offers the potential for assembly of novel product-formation pathways, as well as mechanisms for increased solvent tolerance. Thus, synthetic biology may finally lead to cheap and effective processes for conversion of biomass to useful products.},

@article{Husson2012,
abstract = {An experimental study of the oxidation of ethylcyclohexane has been performed in a jet-stirred reactor with online gas chromatography, under quasi-atmospheric pressure (800 Torr), at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1100 K (low- and intermediate-temperature zone including the negative temperature coefficient area), at a residence time of 2 s, and for three equivalence ratios (0.25, 1, and 2). Ethylcyclohexane displays important low-temperature reactivity with a well-marked negative temperature coefficient behavior. In addition to 47 products with a mass lower than ethylcyclohexane which have been quantified, many species with a C(8)H(14)O formula (molecular weight of 126) were detected by GC-MS and 7 of them were quantified. These molecules are cyclic ethers, ketones, and aldehydes with the same carbon skeleton as the reactant. Experiments were also carried on under the same conditions for two other C(8) hydrocarbons, n-octane and 1-octene, showing that the reactivity of ethylcyclohexane is close to that of the alkene and lower than that of the alkane. Simulations using a detailed kinetic model of the literature allow a good prediction of the global reactivity and of the main hydrocarbon products for temperatures above 800 K. The main reaction channels leading to the observed reaction products at both low (below 800 K) and intermediate temperature (above 800 K) are discussed.},

@phdthesis{Weber2010,
abstract = {Autoignition delay experiments were performed for n-butanol in a heated rapid compression machine. Experiments were performed at pressures of 15 and 30 bar, in the temperature range 650-900 K, and for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. Additionally, the initial fuel mole fraction and initial oxygen mole fraction were varied independently to determine the influence of each on ignition delay. Over the conditions studied, it was found that the reactivity of the mixture increased as equivalence ratio, initial fuel mole fraction or initial oxygen mole fraction increased. A non-linear correlation to the experimental data was performed and showed nearly second order dependence on the initial oxygen mole fraction and nearly first order dependence on initial fuel mole fraction and compressed pressure. This was the first study of the ignition of n-butanol in this temperature and pressure range, and contributes to a better understanding of the chemistry of this fuel under the conditions relevant to practical devices. Experimentally measured ignition delays were compared against the ignition delay computed from several reaction mechanisms in the literature. The agreement between experiments and simulations was found to be unsatisfactory. Sensitivity analysis was performed and indicated that the uncertainties of the rate constants of parent fuel decomposition reactions play a major role in causing the poor agreement. Further path analysis of the fuel decomposition reactions supported this conclusion and highlighted the particular importance of certain pathways. Based on these results, it was concluded that further investigation of the fuel decomposition, including speciation measurements, will be required.},
